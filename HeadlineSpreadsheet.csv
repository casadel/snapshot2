  RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Feb. 08, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioCryst
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (NASDAQ:BCRX) today announced results from OPuS-2
(Oral ProphylaxiS-2), a clinical trial of avoralstat administered three
times daily as a liquid-filled soft gel formulation for the prophylactic
treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks.
  In the OPuS-2 study, HAE patients with a historical attack frequency of
greater than 0.45 attacks per week were randomized to treatment with either
500 mg or 300 mg of avoralstat, or placebo, administered three times daily
for 12 weeks.  The primary goals of the trial were to characterize the
efficacy of avoralstat in reducing the frequency of angioedema attacks, and
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 12 weeks of avoralstat treatment.
The primary efficacy endpoint was angioedema attack frequency.
  Thirty-eight subjects received avoralstat 500 mg, 36 subjects received
avoralstat 300 mg, and 36 subjects received placebo.  Treatment with 500 mg
and 300 mg of avoralstat three times daily failed to demonstrate a
statistically significantly lower mean attack rate versus placebo.  The mean
(standard deviation) attack rates per week were 0.63 (0.57) on avoralstat
500mg, 0.71 (0.66) on avoralstat 300mg, compared to 0.61 (0.41) on placebo.
  ""OPuS-2 was a well-designed and executed trial that gave us a clear answer;
this dosage form of avoralstat is not a viable formulation to move forward,""
said Jon P. Stonehouse, President & Chief Executive Officer.  ""While we are
disappointed in the study results, we learned that meaningfully better
exposure is needed for avoralstat to succeed. We expect results from a
relative bioavailability study testing a novel solid dosage form of
avoralstat by mid-year -- the primary goals of this study are to achieve
much higher exposures and twice daily dosing. Our other opportunity to
achieve higher exposure of an oral kallikrein inhibitor is with BCX7353 - we
expect results from the BCX7353 APeX-1 dose ranging study in HAE patients by
year end.""
  Secondary efficacy endpoints included measures of quality of life, attack
duration and attack severity. Statistically significant improvements in
duration of attacks and in the Angioedema Quality of Life total score, and
its domains, were observed comparing the 500 mg three times a day avoralstat
arm to placebo.
  Oral administration of avoralstat in OPuS-2 was generally safe and well
tolerated; the adverse event profile was similar to that for placebo; and no
safety signals were observed.

  About Avoralstat
  Discovered by BioCryst, avoralstat is a novel, selective inhibitor of plasma
kallikrein in development for prevention of attacks in patients with
hereditary angioedema (HAE). By inhibiting plasma kallikrein, Avoralstat
suppresses bradykinin production. Bradykinin is the mediator of acute
swelling attacks in HAE patients.
  About Hereditary Angioedema
  HAE is a rare, severely debilitating and potentially fatal genetic condition
that occurs in about 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 people. HAE symptoms include
recurrent episodes of edema in various locations, including the hands, feet,
face, genitalia and airway. In addition, patients often have bouts of
excruciating abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting that are caused by swelling
in the intestinal wall. Airway swelling is particularly dangerous and can
lead to death by asphyxiation. Further information regarding HAE can be
found at www.haea.org.
  About BioCryst Pharmaceuticals
  BioCryst Pharmaceuticals designs, optimizes and develops novel small
molecule drugs that block key enzymes involved in rare diseases. BioCryst's
ongoing development programs include oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors for
hereditary angioedema; avoralstat, BCX7353 and other second generation
compounds, and BCX4430, a broad spectrum viral RNA polymerase inhibitor. For

  Company to Host Conference Call Today, November 28, at 5:00 p.m. EST
  BOULDER, Colo., Nov. 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nivalis Therapeutics, Inc.
(NASDAQ:NVLS), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on treating
people with cystic fibrosis (""CF""), today announced topline results from the
Company's Phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of two doses of
cavosonstat, 200 mg and 400 mg, in adult patients with CF who had two copies
of the F508del-CFTR mutation and were being treated with Orkambi(TM). There
were no dose limiting toxicities and cavosonstat was well tolerated at all
doses in the trial. The trial failed, however, to demonstrate benefit in
absolute change in percent predicted FEV(1) , the trial's primary endpoint,
or in sweat chloride reduction at 12 weeks.
  ""While we are disappointed in the outcome of this trial, we plan to continue
to investigate the therapeutic potential of cavosonstat and our
S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) inhibitor portfolio to  determine
next steps,"" said Jon Congleton, president and chief executive officer of
Nivalis.
  Summary of Key Data
  The data announced today are from a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial that evaluated the efficacy and
safety of two doses of cavosonstat administered twice daily (BID) in adult
patients with CF who were homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and being
treated with Orkambi. The trial included a total of 138 adults who received
treatment with cavosonstat (200 mg) with Orkambi (n=44), cavosonstat (400
mg) with Orkambi (n=48) and placebo with Orkambi (n=46) for 16 weeks. The
trial included a 4-week withdrawal and follow-up period once patients had
completed 12-weeks of dosing.
  The primary endpoint of the trial was change in absolute percent predicted
FEV(1) from baseline to week 12. This and key secondary endpoints are shown
in the table below.

12%, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement (p<0.05) in the
incidence of complete clearance of all baseline warts compared to vehicle
treatment after 12 weeks in both the intent-to-treat and per-protocol
analyses.
  ""These data are impressive. The magnitude of effect with favorable
tolerability provides us great enthusiasm for patients suffering from the
most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States,"" said
Nathan Stasko, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Novan.
""Importantly, SB206 represents another drug candidate from our platform that
has now shown the repeatability of taking a fundamental nitric oxide
mechanism of action, generating compelling preclinical evidence and then
translating that success into statistically significant results in Phase 2
clinical trials. Genital warts was our first viral target, and as we develop
SB206 further we intend to diligently investigate the numerous other viral
skin infections in need of new treatment options.""
  In this randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial, the
safety and efficacy of SB206 was evaluated in 107 patients with external
genital warts and perianal warts. The dose and dosing frequency of SB206 was
tested in four independent cohorts in which patients were randomized in a
3:1 ratio to either SB206 or vehicle and treated for up to 12 weeks. SB206
doses included SB206 4% twice-daily, 4% once-daily, 8% once-daily and the
highest dose evaluated, 12% once-daily. Patients eligible for this clinical
trial were males or females, 18 to 50 years of age, with 2 to 20 warts on
the genital or perianal area. The mean wart count burden per patient at
baseline was 7.4 warts.
  The primary endpoint for this clinical trial was the proportion of patients
who were completely clear of warts that were present at baseline at or
before week 12. In the intent-to-treat analysis, 33% of patients achieved
complete clearance of all warts by week 12 when treated with SB206 12%
once-daily, compared to only 4% of patients achieving complete clearance
with vehicle once-daily (p=0.0099). In the per-protocol analysis containing
patients who completed a full 12 weeks of dosing, 42% of patients achieved
complete clearance of all warts when treated with SB206 12% once-daily,
compared to only 7% of patients achieving complete clearance with vehicle
once-daily (p=0.0200).
  The cutaneous tolerability of SB206 was carefully monitored and recorded
using scores on a four-point grading scale for erythema, edema, erosions or
ulcers and burning or stinging. The once-daily treatment arms were generally
well tolerated, including the most effective dose, 12% once-daily. The most
frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were application site
reactions, the percentage of which was highest in patients treated with
SB206 4% twice-daily. Based on the local application site adverse-event
profile and the Company's strict, pre-specified stopping criteria, SB206 4%
twice-daily was discontinued, and all of the remaining cohorts were dosed
once-daily.
  ""I am honored to be part of the SB206 investigative team, and it was
exciting to observe the clinical benefits that a number of my patients
experienced during the Phase 2 trial,"" said Dr. Valentin Almendarez, Jr.,
board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist at the Institute For Women's
Health in San Antonio. ""I believe that Novan's topical nitric
oxide-releasing gel, SB206, could be a valuable treatment alternative to
existing prescription therapies and locally destructive procedures, with a
mechanism of action that would be truly groundbreaking for the treatment of
viral infections if approved.""
  ""Our SB206 development program now includes in vitro evidence against
high-risk HPV-18 in a human raft cell culture model, in vivo data against
papilloma virus in rabbits, and clinical evidence from our Phase 2 trial
against genital warts commonly caused by HPV-6 and -11,"" said Dr. M. Joyce
Rico, board-certified dermatologist and Chief Medical Officer of Novan. ""The
ability to directly inhibit viral replication suggests that our nitric
oxide-releasing technology may demonstrate activity against a broad spectrum
of HPV strains, including high-risk subtypes associated with cancers of the
head, neck and cervix.""
  Based on the data generated in this Phase 2 dose-ranging trial, Novan
expects to discuss the entirety of the SB206 development program with the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the first half of 2017 and,
assuming a successful end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, plans to initiate
the Company's late-stage program with Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials of
SB206 in the second half of 2017.
  About Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Genital Warts
  HPV refers to a large family of double-stranded DNA viruses that induce
abnormal growths on the skin or mucosal surfaces. HPV affects nearly 80
million Americans, and an estimated 14 million new cases of the virus are
reported each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, or CDC. There are over 100 subtypes of the virus, characterized
as low-risk or high-risk based on their cancer-causing potential. The virus
is typically transmitted via direct skin-to-skin contact through disruptions
in the normal skin barrier. All warts are caused by HPV, including genital
and perianal warts, common warts and plantar warts.
  Genital warts are among the world's most common sexually transmitted
diseases. Genital warts are usually flesh-colored growths that can be
raised, flat or cauliflower-shaped and are typically found on the surface of
the external genitalia or in and around the anus. In males, they can appear
on the surface of the penis and scrotum, and in females inside the vagina or
on the cervix. Genital warts carry a substantial psychosocial burden due to
the shame and embarrassment related to having a sexually transmitted disease
as well as the inconvenience and discomfort of current treatment modalities.
Current treatment options for genital warts consist of ablative procedures
that cut, burn or freeze the warts but do not address the underlying viral
infection, and there are no currently approved oral or topical prescription
products indicated for the treatment of genital warts with a direct
anti-viral mechanism of action.

  Study Conducted in Young Adults with Type 1 Diabetes and High Baseline A1C
  PR Newswire
  THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Dec. 5, 2016
  THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Dec. 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Lexicon Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (Nasdaq: LXRX) announced top-line results today from a Phase 2 clinical
study of sotagliflozin, a dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor, conducted by
Lexicon in collaboration with JDRF, the leading global organization funding
type 1 diabetes research.
  The purpose of this Phase 2 clinical trial, which randomized a total of 87
patients, was to assess the effects of a once-daily 400 mg dose of
sotagliflozin compared to a placebo control in insulin-treated young adults
with type 1 diabetes, aged 18-30 years, and particularly high baseline A1C
levels of greater than or equal to 9.0%, representative of an at-risk
population in which glycemic control and adherence to therapy are
substantial challenges.  The study promoted adherence and encouraged insulin
adjustment as needed to achieve glucose control targets.
  Patients treated with sotagliflozin as an adjunct to insulin had a mean
reduction from baseline in A1C of 1.33% after 12 weeks of treatment.  The
results for the A1C primary endpoint numerically favored sotagliflozin, with
a placebo-adjusted reduction of 0.35%, but did not reach statistical
significance.  A pre-planned subgroup analysis in patients with A1C at
baseline of less than or equal to 10.0% showed a statistically-significant
reduction in this same A1C primary endpoint, with sotagliflozin-treated
patients achieving a mean reduction from baseline in A1C of 1.43% and a
placebo-adjusted reduction of 0.75% (p=0.006).  In secondary measures:
   -- Patients treated with sotagliflozin achieved an increase of
approximately
      one-third in the mean proportion of time spent in the target range of
      70-180 mg/dL (from 33.1% at baseline to 43.6% at week 12) as measured by

      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), as compared to a slight reduction
in
      time in the target range (from 33.5% at baseline to 32.9% at week 12)
for
      patients treated with placebo.

   -- Patients treated with sotagliflozin achieved a mean placebo-adjusted
      reduction from baseline to week 12 of 56.6 mg/dL in two-hour
      post-prandial glucose (PPG) following a standardized mixed meal.

   -- Patients treated with sotagliflozin achieved a mean reduction of 0.62 kg

      in body weight from baseline to week 12, as compared to an increase of
      1.75 kg in body weight for patients treated with placebo.
  Sotagliflozin was well tolerated in the study, with a smaller proportion of
patients on sotagliflozin experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events
(AEs) (58.1% on sotagliflozin vs. 61.9% on placebo) and serious AEs (SAEs)
(4.7% on sotagliflozin vs. 7.1% on placebo).  There were no discontinuations
from study drug due to AEs on sotagliflozin vs. two patients on placebo.
One patient in the sotagliflozin treated arm and two patients in the placebo
arm experienced a severe hypoglycemia event during the 12-week treatment
period.  No patients treated with sotagliflozin experienced a diabetic
ketoacidosis (DKA) event, whereas one placebo-treated patient experienced a
DKA event during the 12-week treatment period and two additional patients
experienced a DKA event during the pre-randomization, placebo run-in period
of the study.  There were no deaths in the study.
  ""Sotagliflozin demonstrated favorable safety in this study in an at-risk
population and continues to show evidence of improvements in the quality of
glucose control consistent with its mechanism of action,"" said Pablo
Lapuerta, M.D., Lexicon's executive vice president and chief medical
officer. ""Reductions in post-prandial glucose were consistent with SGLT1
inhibition in the gastrointestinal tract.  Better control of post-prandial
glucose will allow patients with type 1 diabetes to spend more time with
glucose in a better range, with low rates of severe hypoglycemia.""
  ""We applaud the efforts of Lexicon in prioritizing the development of novel
therapies for the multitudes affected by type 1 diabetes.  Individuals with
type 1 diabetes continue to experience challenges of disease burden and high
levels of A1C, and we expect at least a subset of those to benefit from
novel, add-on therapies to elicit additional glycemic and metabolic
benefits,"" said Sanjoy Dutta, Ph.D., associate vice president, Translational
Development and International Partnerships at JDRF.  ""We are looking forward
to seeing new options for individuals with type 1 diabetes, and we truly
value our partnership with Lexicon as we drive our vision of a world without
type 1 diabetes.""
  About the JDRF Phase 2 Clinical Trial
  The double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase 2 study randomized 87 patients,
aged 18 to 30, in the United States with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump or
multiple daily injection therapy who had an A1C level entering the study
greater than or equal to 9.0%.  The study evaluated a once-daily 400 mg dose
of sotagliflozin, before the first meal of the day, against placebo.  Prior
to randomization, there was a two-week run-in period in which patients
received placebo in addition to insulin.  After completion of the run-in
period, patients were randomized to either sotagliflozin or placebo.  The
mean A1C level at baseline, after the two-week run-in period, was 9.9% in
the sotagliflozin-treated arm and 9.7% in the placebo arm.  Following
randomization, adjustments in insulin doses were made when needed in the
medical judgment of the investigator.  During the 12-week treatment period,
total insulin use increased in the placebo arm and decreased in the
sotagliflozin arm; basal insulin use increased in both the placebo and
sotagliflozin arms, with a greater increase in the placebo arm; and bolus
insulin use decreased in both the placebo and sotagliflozin arms, with a
greater decrease in the sotagliflozin arm.
  About Sotagliflozin
  Discovered using Lexicon's unique approach to gene science, sotagliflozin is
a first-in-class, oral dual inhibitor of two proteins responsible for
glucose regulation known as sodium-glucose co-transporter types 1 and 2
(SGLT1 and SGLT2). SGLT1 is responsible for glucose absorption in the
gastrointestinal tract, and SGLT2 is responsible for glucose reabsorption by
the kidney.
  Lexicon entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi in
November 2015 under which Lexicon granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-bearing right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize
sotagliflozin.  Lexicon is responsible for all clinical development
activities relating to type 1 diabetes and retains an exclusive option to
co-promote and have a significant role, in collaboration with Sanofi, in the
commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in
the United States.  Sanofi is responsible for all clinical development and
commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
worldwide and is solely responsible for the commercialization of
sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes outside the United
States.
  Lexicon announced positive top-line results of its first pivotal Phase 3
clinical trial of sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes, on a
background of optimized insulin (inTandem1), in September 2016.  Lexicon is
conducting a second pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (inTandem2) from which
top-line results are expected later this month.  A third type 1 diabetes
Phase 3 clinical trial, inTandem3, is underway globally and is studying
approximately 1,400 patients treated with sotagliflozin 400 mg once daily or
placebo on a background of any insulin therapy, but without insulin
optimization prior to randomization.  Sanofi is expected to commence Phase 3
clinical trials for sotagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes this
year.

There were no discontinuations from study drug due to AEs on sotagliflozin vs. two patients on placebo. One patient in the sotagliflozin treated arm and two patients in the placebo arm experienced a severe hypoglycemia event during the 12-week treatment period.  No patients treated with sotagliflozin experienced a diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) event, whereas one placebo-treated patient experienced a DKA event during the 12-week treatment period and two additional patients experienced a DKA event during the pre-randomization, placebo run-in period of the study.  There were no deaths in the study.   ""Sotagliflozin demonstrated favorable safety in this study in an at-risk population and continues to show evidence of improvements in the quality of glucose control consistent with its mechanism of action,"" said Pablo Lapuerta, M.D., Lexicon's executive vice president and chief medical officer. ""Reductions in post-prandial glucose were consistent with SGLT1 inhibition in the gastrointestinal tract.  Better control of post-prandial glucose will allow patients with type 1 diabetes to spend more time with glucose in a better range, with low rates of severe hypoglycemia.""   ""We applaud the efforts of Lexicon in prioritizing the development of novel therapies for the multitudes affected by type 1 diabetes.  Individuals with type 1 diabetes continue to experience challenges of disease burden and high levels of A1C, and we expect at least a subset of those to benefit from novel, add-on therapies to elicit additional glycemic and metabolic benefits,"" said Sanjoy Dutta, Ph.D., associate vice president, Translational Development and International Partnerships at JDRF.  ""We are looking forward to seeing new options for individuals with type 1 diabetes, and we truly value our partnership with Lexicon as we drive our vision of a world without type 1 diabetes.""   About the JDRF Phase 2 Clinical Trial   The double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase 2 study randomized 87 patients, aged 18 to 30, in the United States with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump or multiple daily injection therapy who had an A1C level entering the study greater than or equal to 9.0%.  The study evaluated a once-daily 400 mg dose of sotagliflozin, before the first meal of the day, against placebo.  Prior to randomization, there was a two-week run-in period in which patients received placebo in addition to insulin.  After completion of the run-in period, patients were randomized to either sotagliflozin or placebo.  The mean A1C level at baseline, after the two-week run-in period, was 9.9% in the sotagliflozin-treated arm and 9.7% in the placebo arm.  Following randomization, adjustments in insulin doses were made when needed in the medical judgment of the investigator.  During the 12-week treatment period, total insulin use increased in the placebo arm and decreased in the sotagliflozin arm; basal insulin use increased in both the placebo and sotagliflozin arms, with a greater increase in the placebo arm; and bolus insulin use decreased in both the placebo and sotagliflozin arms, with a greater decrease in the sotagliflozin arm.   About Sotagliflozin   Discovered using Lexicon's unique approach to gene science, sotagliflozin is a first-in-class, oral dual inhibitor of two proteins responsible for glucose regulation known as sodium-glucose co-transporter types 1 and 2 (SGLT1 and SGLT2). SGLT1 is responsible for glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, and SGLT2 is responsible for glucose reabsorption by the kidney.   Lexicon entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi in November 2015 under which Lexicon granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sotagliflozin.  Lexicon is responsible for all clinical development activities relating to type 1 diabetes and retains an exclusive option to co-promote and have a significant role, in collaboration with Sanofi, in the commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in the United States.  Sanofi is responsible for all clinical development and commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes worldwide and is solely responsible for the commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes outside the United States.   Lexicon announced positive top-line results of its first pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes, on a background of optimized insulin (inTandem1), in September 2016.  Lexicon is conducting a second pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (inTandem2) from which top-line results are expected later this month.  A third type 1 diabetes Phase 3 clinical trial, inTandem3, is underway globally and is studying approximately 1,400 patients treated with sotagliflozin 400 mg once daily or placebo on a background of any insulin therapy, but without insulin optimization prior to randomization.  Sanofi is expected to commence Phase 3 clinical trials for sotagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes this year.   About Lexicon   Lexicon is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that is applying a unique approach to gene science based on Nobel Prize-winning technology to discover and develop precise medicines for patients with serious, chronic conditions. Through its Genome5000(TM) program, Lexicon scientists have studied the role and function of nearly 5,000 genes over the last 20 years and have identified more than 100 protein targets with significant therapeutic potential in a range of diseases.

  Atara Bio to Host Conference Call and Webcast Today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern
Time
  SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 14, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atara
Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ATRA) today announced results from its Phase 2
proof-of-concept clinical trial for PINTA 745 for the treatment of protein
energy wasting (PEW) in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). The
trial did not meet its primary endpoint, defined as the percent change from
baseline in Lean Body Mass (LBM) as measured by Dual Energy X-Ray
Absorptiometry (DXA) at week 12 following weekly treatment with PINTA 745.
  PINTA 745 also did not improve physical function, measures of glycemic
control and markers of inflammation. There were no treatment related serious
adverse events observed in the trial.
  ""We are very disappointed that PINTA 745 did not meet the primary endpoint
of this Phase 2 clinical trial. These data are unambiguous and contrast with
prior clinical and preclinical results,"" said Isaac Ciechanover, M.D.
President and Chief Executive Officer of Atara Bio. ""We want to sincerely
thank the patients and investigators for their participation in this trial.""


  As a consequence of these results, Atara Bio will suspend further
development of PINTA 745. To date, third-party direct costs for the
development of PINTA 745 from our inception through the third quarter of
2015 were approximately $10 million.
  The Company will focus its resources on its portfolio of clinical stage
oncology and immunotherapy product candidates, including:
   -- Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Targeted Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte (EBV-CTL),
which
      received breakthrough designation in rituximab refractory EBV associated


      post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders after allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) and is in two ongoing Phase 2
      trials for EBV malignancies;


   -- Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Targeted Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CMV-CTL), which
      is in two Phase 2 clinical trials for refractory CMV infections that
      occur in patients who have received an alloHCT;


   -- Wilms' Tumor 1 Targeted Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (WT1-CTL), which is in
      two ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials assessing safety and initial
      anti-tumor efficacy in patients with hematologic malignancies; and


   -- STM 434, an activin inhibitor, which is in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical
      trial assessing safety and initial anti-tumor efficacy in patients with
      ovarian cancer and other advanced solid tumors.
  Atara ended the third quarter of 2015 with approximately $334.3 million in
cash and cash equivalents and short-term available-for-sale investments,
providing sufficient resources to further advance the Company's oncology and
immunotherapy portfolio, including completion of the ongoing clinical
studies and the planned initiation of two pivotal trials for EBV-CTL.

  -- Neither Study Met Primary Endpoint; Additional Analyses of FORWARD-4
Provide Supportive Evidence of Efficacy --
  -- Third Efficacy Study, FORWARD-5, Will Recruit Additional Patients; Data
May Provide Regulatory Path Forward for ALKS 5461 --
DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 21, 2016--
  Alkermes plc (NASDAQ: ALKS) today announced preliminary topline results from
FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, the first two of three phase 3 efficacy studies to
read out from the comprehensive FORWARD pivotal program for ALKS 5461, a
once-daily, oral investigational medicine with a novel mechanism of action
for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in patients
who have an inadequate response to standard therapies for clinical
depression. Neither of the two studies met the prespecified primary efficacy
endpoint, which compared ALKS 5461 to placebo on the change from baseline on
the Montgomery--&#197;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).
  FORWARD-4 tested two dose levels of ALKS 5461 (2mg/2mg and 0.5mg/0.5mg)
compared to placebo. 385 patients entered the study. There was a clear trend
toward efficacy with the 2mg/2mg dose of ALKS 5461 on the primary endpoint,
and post hoc analyses achieved statistical significance for the entire
2mg/2mg dose group on the MADRS endpoint. Based on these analyses, Alkermes
believes that FORWARD-4 provides supportive evidence of the efficacy of ALKS
5461 in the treatment of major depressive disorder.
  FORWARD-3 tested ALKS 5461 (2mg/2mg) compared to placebo. 429 patients
entered the study. Placebo response was greater than that observed in
FORWARD-4 and no treatment effect of ALKS 5461 was observed. Negative trials
due to significant placebo effect are not uncommon in the study of major
depressive disorder.
  FORWARD-5, the third pivotal efficacy study in the FORWARD program, is
ongoing, testing two dose levels of ALKS 5461 (2mg/2mg and 1mg/1mg).
FORWARD-5 shares common design and analysis features with FORWARD-4. Based
on information gained from FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, patient enrollment in
FORWARD-5 will be increased and the statistical analysis plan will be
updated. Alkermes will provide an update later this quarter on the projected
timing of completion of FORWARD-5.
  In the case of a clear positive outcome for FORWARD-5, Alkermes believes
that the evidence provided by it and the previously completed successful,
randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 study, together with supportive
evidence from FORWARD-4, collectively could provide substantial evidence of
efficacy for ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of MDD. In that case,
Alkermes would request a meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's (FDA) Division of Psychiatric Products to discuss the
regulatory path for this Fast Track designated medicine.
  ""We are gaining important insights as we proceed with the FORWARD program
for ALKS 5461. The third pivotal efficacy study, FORWARD-5, is ongoing and
we plan to adapt it to incorporate findings from FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4,""
stated Elliot Ehrich, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Alkermes. ""Clinical
trials of new medicines for the treatment of major depressive disorder are
complicated by significant placebo response. We designed the FORWARD pivotal
program to include three efficacy studies as we recognize that this is a
challenging disease state where multiple clinical studies and expansive
analyses are generally necessary to confirm the efficacy of a new medicine.""

  ""We are steadfast in our commitment to developing new medicines for serious
CNS conditions where there is a clear and compelling need for new treatment
options for patients and their families,"" said Richard Pops, Chief Executive
Officer of Alkermes. ""Major depressive disorder is one of these conditions.
We are building a large body of evidence supporting our belief in the
clinical utility and the novel mechanism of action of ALKS 5461. We await
the results of FORWARD-5 and will determine our next steps along the
regulatory path with those results in hand.""
  In FORWARD-3, the most commonly reported adverse events were nausea,
headache and fatigue, and in FORWARD-4 they were nausea, headache and
dizziness. The safety and tolerability profile of ALKS 5461 was consistent
with that reported for the phase 2 and FORWARD-1 studies.
  About FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4
  FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 are phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter,
placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the safety, tolerability and
efficacy of once-daily ALKS 5461 as adjunctive treatment in patients with
MDD who had an inadequate response to a stable dose of either a selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitor (SNRI). The prespecified primary endpoint of both studies was the
change from baseline in MADRS scores. All participants in the double-blind
portion of the study were eligible to continue in an open-label phase and
receive ALKS 5461 for an additional 12 months.
  About the Phase 3 FORWARD Clinical Program
  The FORWARD (Focused On Results With A Rethinking of Depression) pivotal
program for ALKS 5461 includes three core phase 3 efficacy studies, as well
as additional supportive studies to evaluate the long-term safety, dosing,
pharmacokinetic profile and human abuse potential of ALKS 5461. The primary
efficacy endpoint for the three core efficacy studies is the change from
baseline in Montgomery--&#197;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores.
  Further information about the FORWARD studies can be found at
www.clinicaltrials.gov.
  About ALKS 5461
  ALKS 5461 is a proprietary, oral investigational medicine that acts as a
balanced neuromodulator in the brain and represents a novel mechanism of
action for treating MDD. ALKS 5461 consists of samidorphan and
buprenorphine, and is designed to rebalance brain function that is
dysregulated in the state of depression. In October 2013, the FDA granted
Fast Track status for ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of MDD in
patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies.
  About MDD
  According to the DSM-5(R)  (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fifth Edition), major depressive disorder (MDD) is a condition in
which patients exhibit depressive symptoms, such as a depressed mood or a
loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities consistently for at least a
two-week period, and demonstrate impaired social, occupational, educational
or other important functioning. An estimated 17 million people in the U.S.
suffer from MDD in a given year, (1,2)  the majority of whom may not
adequately respond to initial antidepressant therapy.(3)

All participants in the double-blind portion of the study were eligible to continue in an open-label phase and receive ALKS 5461 for an additional 12 months.   About the Phase 3 FORWARD Clinical Program   The FORWARD (Focused On Results With A Rethinking of Depression) pivotal program for ALKS 5461 includes three core phase 3 efficacy studies, as well as additional supportive studies to evaluate the long-term safety, dosing, pharmacokinetic profile and human abuse potential of ALKS 5461. The primary efficacy endpoint for the three core efficacy studies is the change from baseline in Montgomery--&#197;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores.   Further information about the FORWARD studies can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov.   About ALKS 5461   ALKS 5461 is a proprietary, oral investigational medicine that acts as a balanced neuromodulator in the brain and represents a novel mechanism of action for treating MDD. ALKS 5461 consists of samidorphan and buprenorphine, and is designed to rebalance brain function that is dysregulated in the state of depression. In October 2013, the FDA granted Fast Track status for ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of MDD in patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies.   About MDD   According to the DSM-5(R)  (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition), major depressive disorder (MDD) is a condition in which patients exhibit depressive symptoms, such as a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities consistently for at least a two-week period, and demonstrate impaired social, occupational, educational or other important functioning. An estimated 17 million people in the U.S. suffer from MDD in a given year, (1,2)  the majority of whom may not adequately respond to initial antidepressant therapy.(3)   About Alkermes   Alkermes plc is a fully integrated, global biopharmaceutical company developing innovative medicines for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases.

Pivotal Phase 3 Trials to use Placebo as Comparator

First Phase 3 clinical trial expected to commence in third quarter of 2016

Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCUL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye, today announced the Phase 3 clinical development strategy for its OTX-TP (sustained release travoprost) drug product candidate for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Based on feedback from a recent meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Ocular Therapeutix intends to commence the first of two planned Phase 3 clinical trials in the third quarter of 2016.

The planned trial design for the two Phase 3 clinical trials includes an OTX-TP treatment arm and a placebo-controlled comparator arm that would use a non-drug eluting hydrogel-based intracanalicular depot. The Company does not expect that a timolol comparator or validation arm will be required in the study design and does not expect that eye drops, placebo or active, will be administered in either arm. The Company expects that the FDA will require that OTX-TP show a statistically superior and clinically meaningful reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP), compared to the placebo, as a primary efficacy endpoint.

“We are pleased with the outcome of our recent meeting with the FDA to discuss the Phase 3 clinical development plan for OTX-TP. We believe that a direct comparison of OTX-TP with a placebo comparator reflects the simplest and most real world appropriate clinical study design for this product,” said Amar Sawhney, Ph.D., President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. “This meeting was an important milestone for advancing this program into the next stage of its development. We expect to initiate the first of two planned Phase 3 clinical trials in the third quarter of 2016 after holding an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and finalizing the protocol for the trials.”

Robert Noecker, MD, MBA, Ophthalmic Consultants of Connecticut, and Assistant Clinical Professor, Yale University School of Medicine, stated, “Compliance remains a major issue with all current glaucoma eye drop therapies. Sustained release drug candidates such as OTX-TP address this issue directly, and have the potential to put the control back into the hands of the physician by removing the burden on the patient to administer eye drops every single day. In clinical trials to date, OTX-TP has shown a clinically meaningful IOP lowering effect and has not caused hyperemia, or eye redness, a common side effect of topical glaucoma therapies. It offers a preservative-free formulation that appears to be benign to the ocular surface, which can be adversely affected by preservatives used in eye drops for chronic glaucoma therapy. OTX-TP is a product candidate that may offer an important advancement in the treatment of glaucoma.”

About Glaucoma and Ocular Hypertension

Glaucoma and ocular hypertension are chronic, sight-threatening diseases in which elevated levels of intraocular pressure are associated with damage to the optic nerve, which may result in irreversible vision loss. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world. Ocular hypertension is characterized by elevated levels of intraocular pressure without any optic nerve damage. Patients with ocular hypertension are at high risk of developing glaucoma. In the U.S. alone 2.7 million people suffer from glaucoma. According to IMS Health data, there were 33 million prescriptions and sales of over $2.4 billion of drugs administered by eye drops for the treatment of glaucoma in 2014.

About Sustained Release Travoprost

Sustained Release Travoprost (OTX-TP) is a preservative-free drug product candidate that resides within the canaliculus and delivers the prostaglandin analog travoprost to the ocular surface for up to 90 days. The drug depot is designed to deliver a continuous steady release throughout the treatment period. A fluorescent visualization aid is formulated within the product to enable both the physician and the patient to monitor drug presence throughout the course of therapy.

  LONDON, March 14, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GW Pharmaceuticals plc
(Nasdaq:GWPH) (AIM:GWP) (""GW,"" ""the Company"" or ""the Group""), a
biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and
commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product
platform, announces the positive results of the first pivotal Phase 3 study
of its investigational medicine Epidiolex(R) (cannabidiol or CBD) for the
treatment of Dravet syndrome. In this study, Epidiolex achieved the primary
endpoint of a significant reduction in convulsive seizures assessed over the
entire treatment period compared with placebo (p=0.01). Epidiolex has both
Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) in the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a rare and
debilitating type of epilepsy for which there are currently no treatments
approved in the U.S.
  ""The results of this Epidiolex pivotal trial are important and exciting as
they represent the first placebo-controlled evidence to support the safety
and efficacy of pharmaceutical cannabidiol in children with Dravet syndrome,
one of the most severe and difficult-to-treat types of epilepsy,"" said Orrin
Devinsky, M.D., of New York University Langone Medical Center's
Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. ""These data demonstrate that Epidiolex
delivers clinically important reductions in seizure frequency together with
an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, providing the epilepsy
community with the prospect of an appropriately standardized and tested
pharmaceutical formulation of cannabidiol being made available by
prescription in the future.""
  ""The positive outcome of this Phase 3 trial is a significant milestone in
the development of Epidiolex as a potential new treatment for patients
suffering from Dravet syndrome. We are excited about the potential for
Epidiolex to become the first FDA approved treatment option specifically for
Dravet syndrome patients and their families,"" stated Justin Gover, GW's
Chief Executive Officer. ""In light of this positive data, we will now
request a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA to discuss our proposed regulatory
submission. We also look forward with excitement to the upcoming results
from the two Phase 3 trials in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and the second
pivotal trial in Dravet syndrome.""
  ""Dravet syndrome is one of the most catastrophic types of epilepsy in
children and safe and effective treatments are desperately needed. We are
thrilled to learn of these positive results, which bring much needed hope to
the children and families who have been living with these debilitating
seizures,"" said Mary Anne Meskis, Executive Director of the Dravet Syndrome
Foundation.
  Study Overview
  The Phase 3 study randomized 120 patients into two arms, Epidiolex
20mg/kg/day (n=61) and placebo (n=59). Epidiolex or placebo was added to
current anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment regimens. On average, patients
were taking approximately 3 AEDs, having previously tried and failed an
average of more than 4 other AEDs. The average age of trial participants was
10 years and 30 percent of patients were less than 6 years of age. The
median baseline convulsive seizure frequency per month was 13.
  The primary efficacy endpoint was a comparison between Epidiolex and placebo
measuring the percentage change in the monthly frequency of convulsive
seizures during the 14-week treatment period compared with the 4-week
baseline observation period. In this study, patients taking Epidiolex
achieved a median reduction in monthly convulsive seizures of 39 percent
compared with a reduction on placebo of 13 percent, which was highly
statistically significant (p=0.01). A series of sensitivity analyses of the
primary endpoint confirmed the robustness of this result. The difference
between Epidiolex and placebo emerged during the first month of treatment
and was sustained during the entire treatment period.
  Results from secondary efficacy endpoints reinforced the overall
effectiveness observed with Epidiolex.
  Epidiolex was generally well tolerated in this study. The most common
adverse events (occurring in greater than 10 percent of Epidiolex-treated
patients) were: somnolence, diarrhea, decreased appetite, fatigue, pyrexia,
vomiting, lethargy, upper respiratory tract infection and convulsion.  Of
those patients on Epidiolex that reported an adverse event, 84 percent
reported it to be mild or moderate. Ten patients on Epidiolex experienced a
serious adverse event compared with three patients on placebo. Eight
patients on Epidiolex discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared
with one patient on placebo.
  Further data will be presented in future publications and medical meetings.
  In addition to this first Phase 3 trial, GW is conducting a second Phase 3
trial in Dravet syndrome which is recruiting 150 patients.
  GW Clinical Trial Programs in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Tuberous Sclerosis
Complex
  In addition to the Dravet syndrome trials, GW is conducting the largest
global pivotal clinical trial program to date in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,
another rare and severe form of epilepsy. The first Phase 3 trial is a
placebo-controlled trial of Epidiolex (at a dose of 20 mg/kg) over a 14-week
treatment period and has randomized 171 patients. This trial is expected to
report top-line results in the second quarter of 2016. The second
placebo-controlled trial has randomized a total of 225 patients and is
expected to report top-line results mid-2016. The primary measure of
efficacy in these two trials will be the comparison between Epidiolex and
placebo in the percentage change in number of monthly drop seizures during
the 14-week treatment period compared with the 4-week baseline observation
period.
  Based on the findings of the physician-led expanded access program, GW
continues to identify additional development targets for Epidiolex within
the field of childhood-onset epilepsy disorders. A Phase 3 trial in a third
epilepsy indication, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, is due to commence
imminently and clinical development in a fourth indication is expected to
commence in the second half of 2016.

  About Dravet Syndrome
  Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile-onset and highly treatment-resistant
epileptic syndrome frequently associated with a genetic mutation in sodium
channels. Onset of Dravet syndrome occurs during the first year of life in
previously healthy and developmentally normal infants. Initial seizures are
often temperature related, severe, and long-lasting. Over time, people with
Dravet syndrome can develop multiple types of seizures, including
tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and atypical absences and are prone to bouts of
prolonged seizures called status epilepticus, which can be life threatening.
Risk of premature death including SUDEP (sudden expected death in epilepsy)
is elevated in people with Dravet syndrome. Additionally, the majority will
develop moderate to severe intellectual and development disabilities and
require lifelong supervision and care. There are currently no FDA-approved
treatments and nearly all patients continue to have uncontrolled seizures
and other medical needs throughout their lifetime.
  About Epidiolex (cannabidiol)
  Epidiolex, GW's lead cannabinoid product candidate, is a liquid formulation
of pure plant-derived CBD, which is in development for the treatment of a
number of rare childhood-onset epilepsy disorders. GW has conducted
extensive pre-clinical research of CBD in epilepsy since 2007. This research
has shown that CBD has significant anti-epileptiform and anticonvulsant
activity using a variety of in vitro and in vivo models and has the ability
to treat seizures in acute animal models of epilepsy with significantly
fewer side effects than existing anti-epileptic drugs. To date, GW has
received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for Epidiolex in the treatment
of both Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Additionally, GW has
received Fast Track Designation from the FDA and Orphan Designation from the
European Medicines Agency for Epidiolex for the treatment of Dravet
syndrome. GW is currently evaluating additional clinical development
programs in other orphan seizure disorders.

for Vitaros(R) in Europe and NDA Re-Submission in the U.S. in Q3 2016
  Conference Call / Webcast Today, Monday, March 28, 2016 at 9:00 a.m. ET
  SAN DIEGO, March 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apricus Biosciences, Inc.
(Nasdaq:APRI), a biopharmaceutical company advancing innovative medicines in
urology and rheumatology, today announced top-line results from the Phase 2b
proof-of-concept study of fispemifene in men with secondary hypogonadism and
sexual dysfunction. This study was a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study enrolling approximately 160 men to assess safety
and tolerability, as well as the ability of fispemifene to improve the
sexual function outcomes of erectile function and low libido compared to
placebo in men with secondary hypogonadism.
  While fispemifene at 450mg demonstrated statistically significant
improvements in total, percent free and percent bioavailable testosterone
compared to placebo (P < 0.0001 at both 4 and 8 weeks), the magnitude of the
increase was not sufficient to achieve statistical significance for either
the erectile function primary endpoint or low libido secondary endpoint.
Erectile function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile
Function erectile function domain (IIEF-EF) questionnaire and Sexual
Encounter Profile (SEP) diaries and low libido/desire was assessed using the
Psychosexual Daily Questionnaire (PDQ).
  Fispemifene was generally well-tolerated, and no new or significant safety
issues arose from this study. Rates of adverse events were similar between
groups with the majority of adverse events being mild or moderate. There
were no serious adverse events experienced on fispemifene and there were
very few discontinuations. There were no elevations in testosterone above
the normal range, and no concerns related to consistent increases in
hemoglobin, hematocrit or prostate-specific antigen.
  ""We are obviously disappointed with these results,"" said Richard Pascoe,
Chief Executive Officer of Apricus. ""As a consequence of these results, we
will discontinue all development of fispemifene in symptomatic secondary
hypogonadism, and focus our resources on our other homegrown pipeline
assets.  Specifically, we will focus on growing ex-U.S. Vitaros(R) revenues,
seeking U.S. Vitaros approval in 2017, and advancing RayVa(TM) with a Phase
2 clinical development program.  We believe that focusing on these higher
return assets, along with streamlining the organization and reducing our
operating expenses, is in the best interest of shareholders.""
  ""While we did see statistically meaningful changes in testosterone levels
into the low normal ranges with fispemifene, the compound's ability to
increase those levels sufficiently to demonstrate clinical benefit is
limited, and may be an issue with the entire SERM class. The regulatory
benchmark for approval of a compound in secondary hypogonadism in men is the
achievement of a symptomatic clinical benefit, using patient-reported
outcome (PRO) measures in a defined patient population. Achievement of
biochemical or PK normalization of testosterone into the low normal range is
not sufficient for regulatory purposes,"" said Barbara Troupin, MD, Chief
Medical Officer of Apricus.

Demonstrating Migraine Prevention in Patients with Chronic Migraine
  Alder Also Reports Positive Phase 1 Data Supporting Quarterly Single
Injection Dosing Strategy for ALD403
  Alder to Host Conference Call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Today
  BOTHELL, Wash., March 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alder BioPharmaceuticals,
Inc. (NASDAQ:ALDR), today announced positive top-line data from two clinical
trials evaluating ALD403, Alder's proprietary monoclonal antibody product
candidate for migraine prevention that targets calcitonin gene-related
peptide (CGRP). Positive top-line data from a Phase 2b study of patients
with chronic migraine demonstrated that ALD403 acted rapidly and prevented
migraine over the entire 12 week study period, meeting both primary and
secondary efficacy endpoints.  Additionally, positive Phase 1 study data
demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics by intravenous
(IV), subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) injection of ALD403 support a
quarterly single injection dosing strategy.
  Randall C. Schatzman, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Alder,
commented: ""Today's ALD403 Phase 2b data confirm and expand on our previous
data demonstrating robust efficacy in migraine prevention in a severely
afflicted patient group. Evaluation of ALD403 continues to exhibit a
potential best-in-class profile, which includes immediate, significant and
durable migraine prevention with infrequent quarterly dosing. Today's data
also support our quarterly dosing strategy via a single intravenous,
subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. With our commitment to the
accelerated development of ALD403 reinforced by today's positive results, we
look forward to advancing our development plan, and assuming FDA approval,
independently marketing ALD403 in the U.S. to meet the critical medical
needs of the 13 million patients nationwide who are candidates for migraine
prevention therapy.""
  Phase 2b Clinical Trial Evaluating ALD403 in Patients with Chronic Migraine
  The Phase 2b clinical trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomized, single intravenous infusion, dose ranging study in patients with
chronic migraine. Patients were randomized to receive a single intravenous
infusion of 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg or 300 mg of ALD403 or placebo
(approximately 120 patients per group). The primary efficacy endpoint of the
study is the change in migraine days between ALD403 and placebo as
determined by the 75% responder rates over a 12-week period. Endpoints will
also be evaluated at week 24 (expected Q3 2016) and at week 48 (end of
study).
  Chronic migraine sufferers are defined as individuals who experience 15 or
more headache days per month, of which at least 8 must be assessed as
migraine days.
  Key Points
   -- The 300 mg and 100 mg dose levels of ALD403 met the primary efficacy
      endpoint of the study, a 75% reduction in migraine days over the entire
      12 weeks in 33% and 31% of patients, respectively (p < 0.05).

  *(p= < 0.05)   **(p= < 0.01)
   -- A single administration of ALD403 resulted in an immediate and durable
      mean reduction in migraine days from baseline throughout the 12 weeks at


      the 300 mg (p < 0.01), 100 mg (p < 0.01) and 30 mg (p < 0.05) dose
levels,
      meeting the secondary efficacy endpoint.


   -- A single administration of ALD403 at 300mg, 100mg or 30mg dose levels
      demonstrated a durable reduction in migraine days for the entire 12
weeks,
      supporting a quarterly dosing strategy.


   -- The 10 mg dose of ALD403 was identified as sub-therapeutic.


   -- The safety profile was consistent with earlier ALD403 clinical trials.
  Phase 1 Clinical Trial Evaluating Multiple Doses of ALD403 in Healthy
Volunteers
  The Phase 1 clinical trial is a placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-dose,
double dummy, quarterly-dosing study comparing the intravenous, subcutaneous
and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy volunteers. Sixty
healthy volunteers, 12 in each group, were randomized as follows:
  -- 100 mg ALD403 IM, placebo SC, placebo IV
  -- 100 mg ALD403 SC, placebo IM, placebo IV
  -- 100 mg ALD403 IV, placebo IM, placebo SC
  -- 300 mg ALD403 IM, placebo SC, placebo IV
  -- Placebo IM, placebo SC, placebo IV
  Individuals were dosed on Day 1 and at Week 12.
  The study evaluated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints for the
administration of ALD403 delivered via each of the three routes of
administration.
  Key Points
   -- ALD403 provided a comparable level of suppression of peripheral CGRP
      biology for a full 3 months when administered via a single intravenous
      (100 mg), subcutaneous (100 mg) or intramuscular injection (100 mg or
300
      mg).


   -- ALD403 administered via subcutaneous or intramuscular routes of
      administration had an approximately 80% bioavailability relative to an
      intravenous infusion.


   -- Local tolerability via all modes of administration was excellent.


   -- The safety profile was consistent with earlier ALD403 clinical trials.


   -- The data support a quarterly dosing strategy as a single injection by
all
      modes of administration.
  The results of this study provide an important bridge between
pharmacodynamic monitoring via peripheral CGRP blockade and migraine
prevention: doses (100mg and 300mg) that provided for a full 3 months of
migraine prevention in the Phase 2b study of chronic migraine patients also
provided 3 months of suppression of peripheral CGRP biology independent of
route of administration.
  Additional results, including future analysis of additional secondary
endpoints, from both of these trials are expected to be presented at
upcoming medical meetings and published in peer-reviewed medical journals.

  About ALD403
  ALD403 is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody that inhibits
calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP, for prevention of migraine. CGRP
is a small protein with a well-established role in the initiation,
mediation, transmission and heightened sensitivity to pain experienced in
migraine. ALD403 was discovered by Alder scientists and has been evaluated
in multiple clinical trials evaluating approximately 800 patients. In a
proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating patients with frequent episodic
migraine, ALD403 demonstrated significant prevention of migraines, including
complete migraine relief (100% suppression of migraine occurrence) in 27% to
41% of patients in any given month. Migraines were completely prevented in
16% of patients for the entire three-month study period. ALD403 also has a
favorable emerging safety profile, demonstrating a similar level of safety
to placebo, and has been well-tolerated in studies to date. Alder initiated
its late-stage clinical trial program in October 2015 with PRevention Of
Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 1 (PROMISE 1), a pivotal
clinical trial evaluating patients with frequent episodic migraine. Alder
plans to initiate a second pivotal clinical trial, PRevention Of Migraine
via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 2 (PROMISE 2), in patients with
chronic migraine in the second half of 2016. Also in 2016, Alder further
plans to enter late-stage clinical development of a self-injected
formulation of ALD403 to complement the infusion formulations evaluated in
the PROMISE 1 and 2 trials.
  About Migraine
  Migraine is a common neurological disorder that results in suffering caused
by intense sharp or throbbing pain in the head, commonly accompanied by
nausea, vomiting and high sensitivity to light and sound. Over time,
patients may be subject to an increasing frequency and severity of migraine
attacks, potentially leading to significant disability.
  The Migraine Research Foundation estimates that 36 million American adults
and children suffer from migraines. According to the American Migraine
Foundation, migraine is three times more common in women than men and
affects 30% of women over a lifetime. Migraines can severely restrict normal
activities and often make holding a job or maintaining a normal lifestyle
difficult. The Migraine Research Foundation estimates U.S. employers lose
more than $13 billion each year as a result of 113 million lost work days
due to migraine.
  Currently, preventive medications approved for migraine include beta
blockers (such as propranolol), topiramate, sodium valproate and botulinum
toxin, or Botox. Medication side-effects, such as cognitive impairment,
nausea, fatigue and sleep disturbance, often limit the use of migraine
medications, according to the American Migraine Foundation. The U.S. Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality reports that only about 12% of adults
with frequent episodic or chronic migraine take preventive medications.
Alder believes this creates a significant unmet medical need for new
treatments with improved safety and efficacy that can either prevent
migraines completely or reduce the frequency to a level where patients can
find adequate relief from existing abortive medications.","Alder Reports Phase 2b Trial of ALD403 Meets Primary and Secondary Endpoints Demonstrating Migraine Prevention in Patients with Chronic Migraine   Alder Also Reports Positive Phase 1 Data Supporting Quarterly Single Injection Dosing Strategy for ALD403   Alder to Host Conference Call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Today   BOTHELL, Wash., March 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.

Also in 2016, Alder further plans to enter late-stage clinical development of a self-injected formulation of ALD403 to complement the infusion formulations evaluated in the PROMISE 1 and 2 trials.   About Migraine   Migraine is a common neurological disorder that results in suffering caused by intense sharp or throbbing pain in the head, commonly accompanied by nausea, vomiting and high sensitivity to light and sound. Over time, patients may be subject to an increasing frequency and severity of migraine attacks, potentially leading to significant disability.   The Migraine Research Foundation estimates that 36 million American adults and children suffer from migraines. According to the American Migraine Foundation, migraine is three times more common in women than men and affects 30% of women over a lifetime. Migraines can severely restrict normal activities and often make holding a job or maintaining a normal lifestyle difficult. The Migraine Research Foundation estimates U.S. employers lose more than $13 billion each year as a result of 113 million lost work days due to migraine.   Currently, preventive medications approved for migraine include beta blockers (such as propranolol), topiramate, sodium valproate and botulinum toxin, or Botox. Medication side-effects, such as cognitive impairment, nausea, fatigue and sleep disturbance, often limit the use of migraine medications, according to the American Migraine Foundation. The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports that only about 12% of adults with frequent episodic or chronic migraine take preventive medications. Alder believes this creates a significant unmet medical need for new treatments with improved safety and efficacy that can either prevent migraines completely or reduce the frequency to a level where patients can find adequate relief from existing abortive medications.",,45%

  CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 31, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Genocea Biosciences,
Inc. (NASDAQ:GNCA), a biopharmaceutical company developing T cell-directed
vaccines and immunotherapies, today announced positive 12 month efficacy
data from its Phase 2 dose optimization trial evaluating GEN-003 for the
treatment of genital herpes. GEN-003 demonstrated sustained and
statistically significant reductions compared to baseline in the rate of
viral shedding 12 months after dosing across multiple dose groups as well as
sustained efficacy at multiple dose levels across secondary endpoints
measuring the impact on clinical disease. GEN-003 was safe and well
tolerated by patients, with no serious adverse events related to the vaccine
in the trial.
  ""We are very pleased with these data, which show that GEN-003 has strong and
durable effects on both HSV-2 viral activity and genital herpes clinical
disease, supporting our belief that GEN-003 could become a cornerstone
treatment for patients affected by this serious disease. Specifically, a
single course of treatment of GEN-003 may offer benefits similar to a full
year of daily administration of oral antivirals -- but with greatly improved
convenience,"" said Chip Clark, president and chief executive officer of
Genocea. ""We anticipate reporting virologic efficacy data for GEN-003 from
our recently-initiated Phase 2b study in the third quarter of 2016, clinical
efficacy data at 6 months post dosing around the end of 2016 and conducting
our end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the first quarter of 2017.""
  ""These 12 month data highlight the potential of GEN-003 to significantly
enhance the genital herpes treatment landscape,""  said Lori A. Panther,
M.D., MPH, infectious diseases specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.
""Because of the physical and psychological impact of this disease, both
patients and treating physicians would be eager to use an effective
treatment that more conveniently improves control of outbreaks. The
reduction in viral shedding, which is thought to cause the epidemic spread
of genital herpes, is also encouraging.""
  Genocea has already advanced the two most promising doses, 60 ug per protein
combined with either 50 or 75 ug of Matrix-M2(TM)  adjuvant, from this Phase
2 dose optimization study into an ongoing Phase 2b efficacy trial. The
efficacy of GEN-003 at these two dose levels over the course of the Phase 2
dose optimization trial is as follows:

  About the GEN-003 Phase 2 Clinical Trial
  This Phase 2 study enrolled 310 subjects from 17 institutions in the United
States. Subjects were randomized to one of six dosing groups of either 30 ug
or 60 ug per protein paired with one of three adjuvant doses (25 ug, 50 ug,
or 75 ug). A seventh group received placebo. Subjects received three doses
of GEN-003 or placebo at 21-day intervals. Baseline viral shedding and
genital lesion rates were established for each subject in a 28-day
observation period prior to the commencement of dosing by collecting 56
genital swab samples (two per day), which were analyzed for the presence of
HSV-2 DNA, and by recording the days on which genital lesions were present.
This 28-day observation period was repeated immediately after the completion
of dosing and at six and, twelve months following dosing. No booster doses
were given. After the 28-day observation period immediately after dosing,
patients in the placebo arm were rolled over across the 6 active
combinations of GEN-003 and Matrix-M2 under a separate protocol.

  About GEN-003
  Inducing a T cell response against HSV-2 is critical to treating the
clinical symptoms of disease and controlling transmission of the infection.
GEN-003 is a first-in-class T-cell directed immunotherapy designed to elicit
both a T cell and B cell (antibody) immune response. The immunotherapy was
designed using Genocea's ATLAS(TM) platform, which profiles the
comprehensive spectrum of actual T cell responses mounted by humans in
response to disease, to identify antigen targets that drive T cell response.
GEN-003 includes the antigens ICP4 and gD2 along with Matrix-M2(TM)
adjuvant, which Genocea licenses from Novavax, Inc. For more information

  About Genital Herpes
  Genital Herpes affects more than 400 million people worldwide and causes
recurrent, painful genital lesions. It can be transmitted to sexual
partners, even when the disease is asymptomatic. Current genital herpes
therapies only partially control clinical symptoms and viral shedding, a
process which drives disease transmission. Incomplete control of genital
lesions and transmission risk, expense and the perceived inconvenience of
taking a daily medication are hurdles for long-term disease management.
Immunity through T cells is believed to be particularly critical to the
control and possible prevention of genital herpes infections.
  About Genocea
  Genocea is harnessing the power of T cell immunity to develop life-changing
vaccines and immunotherapies. T cells are increasingly recognized as a
critical element of protective immune responses to a wide range of diseases,
but traditional discovery methods have proven unable to identify the targets
of such protective immune response. Using ATLAS, its proprietary technology
platform, Genocea identifies these targets to potentially enable the rapid
development of medicines to address critical patient needs. Genocea's
pipeline of novel clinical stage T cell-enabled product candidates includes
GEN-003 for genital herpes, GEN-004 for the prevention of infection by all
serotypes of pneumococcus (development suspended pending further data
analysis and consultation with our advisers), and earlier-stage programs in
chlamydia, genital herpes prophylaxis, malaria and cancer immunotherapy. For

  THE WOODLANDS, Texas, April 12, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Repros Therapeutics
Inc.(R) (Nasdaq:RPRX) today reported that vaginal administration of
Proellex(R) at doses of both 6 and 12 mg achieved significant reduction in
excessive menstrual bleeding, the key symptom of uterine fibroids.
  Normal menstrual blood loss in a menstrual cycle is approximately 35 mL.
Woman experiencing blood loss of >80 mL are considered to suffer from
menorrhagia or excessive menstrual bleeding. In this small Phase 2b study,
13, 15 and 14 women with confirmed uterine fibroids were enrolled in the
6mg, 12mg and placebo arms, respectively. At baseline, the mean amount of
blood lost for one menstrual cycle was 255 mL, 274 mL and 238 mL for each
arm, respectively. The blood loss ranged from a low of 94 mL to a high of
654 mL. The most severe menstrual bleeding at baseline was observed in the
12 mg group. Blood loss was determined by collecting all sanitary products
used from an individual and then an alkaline hematin assay was performed to
estimate the actual amount of blood collected in the pads.
  When a sufficient concentration of Proellex(R) is achieved in circulation,
amenorrhea (cessation of menses) is achieved. Just over half, 52%, of
Proellex(R) -treated subjects became amenorrheic with no evidence of a dose
effect. All subjects treated with Placebo continued to menstruate throughout
the 18 week dosing period. The p-value for this comparison is 0.0011.
Bleeding diaries consistently report a statistically significant difference
in the number of days of bleeding and bleeding intensity between those
treated with Proellex(R) and Placebo.
  Bleeding was also evaluated by PBAC (Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart).
Subjects tallied sanitary product usage and stain size as guided by the
chart.  Proellex(R) -treated subjects reported a median 100% reduction in
PBAC scores while Placebo-treated subjects reported a 25.4% reduction,
further supporting the treatment affect associated with bleeding (p=0.0033).

  Along with changes in menstrual patterns, fibroids measured by MRI were
reduced in volume in the Proellex(R) -treated arms by 18% while the Placebo
group showed continued increase in size, p= 0.0437.
  The drug was generally well tolerated. Women in the drug arms continued to
exhibit levels of estradiol consistent with bone preservation.
  After the first 18 week treatment period, the women were withdrawn from drug
to allow for menses. The women in the study are currently being treated with
the second course of treatment for another 18 weeks. The study treatment
assignment remains blinded to the subjects, physicians and those managing
the study and data. The results of the second course of treatment should be
reported within the next 5 months.
  The Company believes Proellex(R) represents a significant advantage over
GnRH agonists and antagonists in the treatment of uterine fibroids. Once
both the vaginal and oral studies complete both 18 week courses of treatment
the Company plans to request an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to
jointly discuss plans for Phase 3.

Primary endpoint for ocular itching not achieved

Conference call today at 8:30 am Eastern Time

Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCUL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye, today announced topline results from its second Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DEXTENZA™ (sustained release dexamethasone) Intracanalicular Depot for the treatment of ocular itching associated with chronic allergic conjunctivitis. DEXTENZA is a product candidate administered by a physician as a bioresorbable intracanalicular depot and designed for drug release to the ocular surface for up to 30 days.

The single primary endpoint of the trial, defined as the difference in the mean scores in ocular itching between the treatment group and the placebo comparator group at three time points 7 days following insertion of the depots, was not achieved. While mean ocular itching was seen to be numerically lower (more favorable) in the DEXTENZA treatment group compared to the placebo group measured 7 days following insertion of the depots, at 3, 5, and 7 minutes by -0.18, -0.29, and -0.29 units, respectively, on a five point scale, this difference did not reach statistical significance. In addition, the trial did not achieve the requirement of at least a 0.5 unit difference at all three time points 7 days following insertion of the depots and at least a 1.0 unit difference at the majority of the three time points between the treatment group and the placebo group 7 days following insertion of the depots.

The trial also assessed conjunctival redness as a secondary endpoint. The differences in the mean scores in conjunctival redness between the DEXTENZA treatment group and the placebo group 7 days following insertion of the depots at 7, 15 and 20 minutes were -0.35, -0.39 and -0.42, respectively, compared with values of -0.26, -0.32 and -0.41, respectively, at the same time points 7 days following insertion of the depots in the first Phase 3 trial.

The results from the second Phase 3 trial contrast with those achieved in the first Phase 3 clinical trial of DEXTENZA for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis announced in October 2015, in which the primary endpoint of treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis was successfully achieved, with mean ocular itching scores being lower in the DEXTENZA group at 3, 5, and 7 minutes by -1.02, -0.87, and -1.04 units, respectively (p<0.0001), 7 days following insertion of the depots.

In the second Phase 3 clinical trial, as well as other DEXTENZA clinical trials completed to date regardless of indication, DEXTENZA has exhibited a strong safety profile and has been generally well-tolerated. There were no serious adverse events observed in the second Phase 3 clinical trial.

“We are disappointed that the primary endpoint of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis was not achieved in our second Phase 3 trial in these patients, and this result is inconsistent with what we saw in our first Phase 3 trial,” said Amar Sawhney, Ph.D., President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. “We are currently in the process of conducting a thorough analysis of the data from the second Phase 3 trial to fully understand the difference in efficacy between the two Phase 3 trials. There was a greater variability in ocular itching exhibited by patients in the second Phase 3 trial over the multiple allergen challenges 7, 14 and 28 days following insertion of the depots, compared to the first Phase 3 trial. In a post hoc analysis, when ocular itching scores were averaged over these multiple visits, a statistically significant reduction of symptoms over the entire 1 month intended duration of sustained release, single dose therapy was observed in the DEXTENZA treatment group relative to the placebo vehicle group. Since this analysis was not part of the original end points, we plan to meet with the FDA to discuss the results and chart an appropriate path forward for the development of DEXTENZA for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.”

Dr. Sawhney continued, “We remain confident in the potential of our innovative sustained release platform to address diverse applications in ophthalmology. We look forward to the July 2016 PDUFA date for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain.”

Second Phase 3 Study Design

This Phase 3 prospective, U.S.-based multicenter, 1:1 randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled trial in 86 patients was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DEXTENZA™ (sustained release dexamethasone), Intracanalicular Depot for the treatment of signs and symptoms of chronic allergic conjunctivitis. This was the second Phase 3 trial which evaluated DEXTENZA versus a placebo vehicle punctum plug using Ophthalmic Research Associate’s modified Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (Ora-CAC®) Model (Ora, Inc., Andover, MA), which accommodates for the longer therapeutic effect of a seasonal one-time administered drug product.

The trial was designed to assess the effect of DEXTENZA compared with placebo on allergic reactions. DEXTENZA or placebo was administered 48 to 72 hours after the first set of allergen challenges confirming the appropriate allergen and dose exposure to incite an allergic response, followed by three series of successive allergen challenges over a 30 day period. The primary efficacy endpoint evaluated was the difference in mean scores in ocular itching between the treatment group and the placebo vehicle group at three time points 7 days following insertion of the depots. The trial also included a secondary efficacy endpoint for conjunctival redness which evaluated the difference in mean scores in conjunctival redness between the treatment group and the placebo vehicle group at three time points 7 days following insertion of the depots.

Ocular Therapeutix reported topline results of its first Phase 3 allergic conjunctivitis clinical trial with DEXTENZA in October 2015, where the primary endpoint for ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis was successfully achieved and the primary endpoint for conjunctival redness was not achieved.

About Allergic Conjunctivitis

Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva resulting primarily from a reaction to allergy-causing substances such as pollen or pet dander. The primary symptom of this inflammation is acute ocular itching and the primary sign is conjunctival redness. Allergic conjunctivitis ranges in clinical severity from relatively mild, common forms to more severe forms that can cause impaired vision. According to a study on the management of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis published in 2012 in the peer-reviewed journal Acta Ophthalmologica, allergic conjunctivitis affects 15% to 40% of the U.S. population. For patients with chronic or more severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis, antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers are often not sufficient to treat their signs and symptoms. Many ocular allergy sufferers are not responsive to the conventional dual-acting antihistamine/mast cell stabilizers. These refractory patients are frequently treated with topical corticosteroids administered by eye drops.

About the Modified Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (Ora-CAC®) Model

The modified Ora-CAC® model used in the recently completed clinical trial has been developed to study the interactions between the early and late phases of the allergic response in the eye, and to evaluate the effects of pharmaceutical intervention. The modified Ora-CAC® model utilizes four challenges conducted over a 2-day interval to evaluate the effectiveness of a test agent to prevent an acute ocular allergic reaction, as well as evaluate the test agent’s ability to prevent an acute ocular allergic reaction in the presence of subclinical late phase inflammation.

  Conference Call Today at 8:00 a.m. ET
  RADNOR, Pa., June 13, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(Nasdaq:MRNS), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of
innovative therapeutics to treat epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders,
today announced top-line results from its Phase 3 clinical trial in adults
with drug-resistant focal onset seizures.  In this trial, ganaxolone did not
meet the primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant
difference from placebo. Consistent with previously conducted studies,
ganaxolone was generally safe and well tolerated.  Marinus plans to
discontinue its program in adult focal onset seizures and focus its efforts
on advancing ganaxolone in status epilepticus and pediatric orphan
indications.
  Christopher M. Cashman, chief executive officer of Marinus Pharmaceuticals,
commented, ""We are disappointed with the outcome of this study, and the
unfortunate impact on the epilepsy community and particularly the patients
suffering from drug-resistant focal onset seizures who are benefiting from
ganaxolone treatment. We remain confident in the safety profile of
ganaxolone and its ability to effectively reduce seizures in targeted
patient populations.  We are committed to building our ganaxolone franchise
and are confident in the potential of ganaxolone in the treatment of status
epilepticus and pediatric orphan seizure and behavior disorders. We will
provide an update in the upcoming weeks on our clinical programs in these
indications.""
  The study missed its primary endpoint of percent change in the 28-day
seizure frequency from baseline (p=0.1537). The median percent reduction of
focal onset seizures in the ganaxolone group was 21.28% compared to 10.25%
with placebo during the titration and the 12-week treatment period.
  The safety profile of ganaxolone in this study was consistent with
previously conducted studies.  Overall, ganaxolone was generally safe and
well tolerated with no imbalance between the ganaxolone and placebo group in
the number of patients with serious adverse events reported (5% vs. 5.1%).
The most common adverse events (>5%) reported at greater rates than placebo
were somnolence (23.5% vs 4.5%), dizziness (19.6% vs 4.5%) and fatigue
(11.7% vs 6.8%). The majority of these adverse events were rated as mild in
severity. There were 44 (25%) patients on ganaxolone that discontinued the
study compared to 26 (14%) patients on placebo. The most common reason for
discontinuation was adverse event.
  The Phase 3 multi-national, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
study was conducted at 61 sites in the United States, Germany, Poland,
Australia, Bulgaria and Russia.  The study randomized 359 patients into two
arms, ganaxolone 1800 mg/day (n=179) and placebo (n=180). The mean age of
the study population was 41 with 63% percent of the participants being
female. Mean years since epilepsy diagnosis was 24.5 years.  76% of the
patients were receiving two or more concomitant AED's and 12% had been
treated with Vagus Nerve Stimulator.
  Dr. Albena Patroneva, chief medical officer of Marinus Pharmaceuticals,
commented, ""The design, conduct, patient demographics and median separation
versus placebo were similar to our positive Phase 2 trial and other studies
conducted with recently approved antiepileptic drugs. While we did not see
the incremental efficacy at a higher dose that we were hoping to achieve,
ganaxolone continued to display a good safety profile -- a key attribute for
the product's future development. We will leverage the findings from this
study in the conduct of our ongoing and future studies in pediatric orphan
indications and status epilepticus.""

  About Drug-Resistant Epilepsy
  Epileptic seizures require chronic treatment, often over a lifetime.
Available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are efficacious for many patients, but
chronic treatment is complicated by side effects, including cardiovascular
risks, liver enzyme induction, kidney stones, behavioral changes, sedation
and adverse effects on cognitive function, drug tolerance, and reproductive
risk. According to Decision Resources, in 2014 approximately five million
people were under treatment for epilepsy in the United States, Europe and
Japan. Despite the many available AEDs, approximately 30 to 35% of patients
do not attain acceptable seizure control either with a single AED or
polypharmacy. Furthermore, medications with significant side effects or
dosing regimens that undermine compliance make it difficult for patients to
achieve and maintain seizure free status. For these reasons there is a need
for new AEDs with novel mechanisms of action and improved side effect
profiles that can maintain seizure control with chronic administration for
people with drug-resistant epilepsy.
  About Ganaxolone
  Ganaxolone is a CNS-selective GABA(A) modulator being developed in three
different dose forms (IV, capsule, and liquid) intended to maximize
therapeutic reach to adult and pediatric patient populations in both acute
and chronic care settings. Ganaxolone acts on a well-characterized synaptic
and extrasynaptic GABA(A)  target known for anti-seizure and anti-anxiety
activity. Ganaxolone has been studied in more than 1,300 subjects, both
pediatric and adult, at therapeutically relevant dose levels and treatment
regimens for up to two years. In these studies, ganaxolone was generally
safe and well tolerated, with the most commonly reported adverse events of
somnolence, dizziness and fatigue.
  About Marinus Pharmaceuticals
  Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to
the development of ganaxolone, which offers a new mechanism of action,
demonstrated efficacy and safety and convenient dosing, to improve the lives
of patients suffering from epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders.
Ganaxolone is a CNS-selective GABA(A) modulator that acts on a
well-characterized target in the brain known to have both anti-seizure and
anti-anxiety effects. Ganaxolone is being developed in three different dose
forms (IV, capsule and liquid) intended to maximize therapeutic reach to
adult and pediatric patient populations in both acute and chronic care
settings. Ganaxolone IV is planned to enter clinical trials in 2016 and is
being developed to treat status epilepticus. Ganaxolone IV is complemented
by its oral dose forms, providing the potential for IV-to-oral continuation
therapy for patients transitioning from acute care to outpatient settings.
Ganaxolone capsule and liquid are being studied in orphan pediatric
indications with comorbidities in seizures and behavior disorders -- PCDH19
epilepsy and Fragile X Syndrome. For more information visit

  WALTHAM, Mass., June 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TESARO, Inc.
(NASDAQ:TSRO), an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, today
announced that the Phase 3 NOVA trial of niraparib successfully achieved its
primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS). This trial demonstrated
that niraparib significantly prolonged PFS compared to control among
patients who are germline BRCA mutation (gBRCAmut) carriers, among patients
who are not germline BRCA mutation (non-gBRCAmut) carriers but who have
homologous recombination deficient (HRD) tumors as determined by the Myriad
myChoice(R) HRD test, and overall in patients who are not germline BRCA
mutation carriers.

  NOVA is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, international Phase 3 trial of
niraparib that enrolled more than 500 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer
who were in a response to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy.
There is currently no therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian
cancer following response to platinum.
  ""We are extremely grateful to the patients, caregivers, and investigators
who participated in the NOVA trial. The results of this study, which is the
first successful, prospectively designed, randomized, well-controlled Phase
3 study of a PARP inhibitor, demonstrate that a single, daily, oral dose of
niraparib is superior to control in prolonging PFS in women with recurrent
ovarian cancer,"" said Mary Lynne Hedley, Ph.D., President and COO of TESARO.
""Importantly, these results show activity of niraparib in a population of
ovarian cancer patients beyond those with germline BRCA mutations. In
keeping with our mission of responsible drug development, NOVA was designed
to define those patients most likely to benefit from niraparib treatment
and, in so doing, optimize the benefit/risk profile for patients. We believe
we have achieved that goal and look forward to presentation of the full data
set from this study at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)
congress in October.""
  Statistically Significant PFS Results in the gBRCAmut Cohort
  Among patients who were germline BRCA mutation carriers, the niraparib arm
successfully achieved statistical significance over the control arm for the
primary endpoint of PFS, with a hazard ratio of 0.27. The median PFS for
patients treated with niraparib was 21.0 months, compared to 5.5 months for
control (p < 0.0001).
  Statistically Significant PFS Results in non-gBRCAmut Cohort for Patients
with HRD Positive Tumors
  For patients who were not germline BRCA mutation carriers but whose tumors
were determined to be HRD positive using the Myriad myChoice(R) HRD test,
the niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical significance over the
control arm for the primary endpoint of PFS, with a hazard ratio of 0.38.
The median PFS for patients with HRD-positive tumors who were treated with
niraparib was 12.9 months, compared to 3.8 months for control (p < 0.0001).
  Statistically Significant PFS Results in the Overall non-gBRCAmut Cohort
  Niraparib also showed statistical significance in the overall non-germline
BRCA mutant cohort, which included patients with both HRD-positive and
HRD-negative tumors. The niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical
significance over the control arm for the primary endpoint of PFS, with a
hazard ratio of 0.45. The median PFS for patients treated with niraparib was
9.3 months, compared to 3.9 months for control (p < 0.0001).
  The most common (>=10%) treatment-emergent grade 3/4 adverse events among
all patients treated with niraparib were thrombocytopenia (28.3%), anemia
(24.8%) and neutropenia (11.2%). Adverse events were generally managed via
dose modifications. The discontinuation rate was 14.7% for niraparib treated
patients and 2.2% for control. The rates of MDS/AML in the niraparib (1.3%)
and control (1.2%) arms were similar. There were no deaths among patients
during study treatment.
  ""The majority of women who are diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer will
experience a relapse of their disease, even if they respond to their initial
chemotherapy,"" said Dr. Tom Herzog, M.D., Clinical Director, University of
Cincinnati Cancer Institute and Professor, Department of Obstetrics and
Gynecology at the University of Cincinnati. ""New treatment options are
needed to extend the time in between cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy
for these patients, and the results from the NOVA study suggest that
niraparib could represent an important new treatment option for many
patients with ovarian cancer.""
  ""While the identification of mutations in the BRCA genes was a significant
advancement, ovarian cancer remains the deadliest of gynecologic cancers,
and new diagnostic and therapeutic options are needed,"" said David Barley,
Chief Executive Officer of the National Ovarian Cancer Coalition. ""The
results of the NOVA trial are encouraging for patients and their families,
and we look forward to seeing the full results of this study this fall.""
  About the Phase 3 NOVA Clinical Trial of Niraparib
  NOVA is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, international Phase 3 trial of
niraparib that planned to enroll 490 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer
who were in a response to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy.
Patients were enrolled into one of two independent cohorts based on germline
BRCA mutation status. One cohort enrolled patients who were germline BRCA
mutation carriers (gBRCAmut), and the second cohort enrolled patients who
were not germline BRCA mutation carriers (non-gBRCAmut). The non-gBRCAmut
cohort included patients with HRD-positive tumors, including those with
somatic BRCA mutations and other HR defects, and patients with HRD-negative
tumors. Within each cohort, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive
niraparib or placebo and were treated continuously with placebo or 300
milligrams of niraparib, dosed as three 100 milligram tablets once per day,
until progression. The primary endpoint of this study was progression-free
survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include patient-reported outcomes,
chemotherapy-free interval length, PFS2, overall survival, and other
measures of safety and tolerability.  More information about this trial is
available at http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01847274.
  Niraparib is an investigational agent and, as such, has not been approved by
the U.S. FDA or any other regulatory agencies.
  About Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD)
  Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is a defect in high-fidelity,
double-strand DNA repair. HRD results from a variety of causes, including
mutations in BRCA and other genes involved in DNA repair, as well as other
unidentified causes.  In cells with HRD, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutant
cells, lack of functional DNA repair pathways, including PARP, leads to
irreparable double-strand breaks, genomic instability, and ultimately cell
death. Because HRD-positive cells are sensitive to DNA-damaging processes,
they are reliant upon proper DNA repair by other pathways, including
PARP-dependent pathways.
  Comprehensive assessment of HRD status includes both tBRCA mutational
analysis and assessment of genomic instability through the combined analysis
of HRD biomarker components LOH, TAI, and LST. myChoiceHRD(R) is a
registered trademark of Myriad Genetics, Inc.
  About Niraparib
  Niraparib is an oral, once-daily PARP inhibitor that is currently being
evaluated in three ongoing pivotal trials. TESARO is building a robust
niraparib franchise by assessing activity across multiple tumor types and by
evaluating several potential combinations of niraparib with other
therapeutics. The ongoing development program for niraparib includes the
Phase 3 trial in patients with ovarian cancer (the NOVA trial) as described
above; a registrational Phase 2 treatment trial in patients with ovarian
cancer (the QUADRA trial); a Phase 3 trial for the treatment of patients
with BRCA-positive breast cancer (the BRAVO trial); and a Phase 3 trial in
patients with first-line ovarian cancer (the PRIMA trial). Several
collaborator-sponsored studies are also underway, including combination
trials of niraparib plus pembrolizumab and bevacizumab. Janssen Biotech has
licensed rights to develop and commercialize niraparib specifically for
patients with prostate cancer worldwide, except in Japan.
  About Ovarian Cancer
  Approximately 22,000 women are diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer in
the United States, and nearly 80% are diagnosed after the disease has become
symptomatic and has progressed to a late stage. Ovarian cancer is the fifth
most frequent cause of cancer death among women. Despite high response rates
to platinum-based chemotherapy in the second-line advanced treatment
setting, 90% of patients will experience recurrence within two years. If
approved, niraparib may address the difficult ""watchful waiting"" periods
experienced by patients with recurrent ovarian cancer in between cycles of
platinum-based chemotherapy.","TESARO's Niraparib Significantly Improved Progression-Free Survival for Patients With Ovarian Cancer in Both Cohorts of the Phase 3 NOVA Trial    -- The NOVA trial successfully achieved its primary endpoint of PFS in the       germline BRCA mutant cohort     -- The NOVA trial successfully achieved its primary endpoint of PFS in the       non-germline BRCA mutant cohort, including both the HRD-positive and       overall analysis populations     -- NOVA is the first successful prospectively designed Phase 3 trial of a       PARP inhibitor     -- NDA and MAA submissions are planned for Q4 2016   WALTHAM, Mass., June 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TESARO, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSRO), an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the Phase 3 NOVA trial of niraparib successfully achieved its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS).

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 12, 2016--
  Sage Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SAGE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company
developing novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system
disorders, today announced positive top-line results from its Phase 2
clinical trial of SAGE-547 for the treatment of severe postpartum depression
(PPD). SAGE-547 achieved the primary endpoint of a significant reduction in
the HAM-D score compared to placebo at 60 hours (p=0.008). This represented
a greater than 20 point mean reduction in the depression scores of the
SAGE-547 group at the primary endpoint of 60 hours through trial completion
with a greater than 12 point difference from placebo. The statistically
significant difference in treatment effect began at 24 hours, (p=0.006) with
an effect that was maintained at similar magnitude through to the 30-day
follow-up (p=0.01). Remission from depression, as determined by a HAM-D <=7,
measured at 60 hours, was seen in 7 of 10 of the SAGE-547 group compared
with 1 of 11 in the placebo group (p=0.008). Similarly, at 30 days, 7 of 10
of the SAGE-547 group and 2 of 11 in the placebo group were in remission
(p=0.03). SAGE-547 was found to be generally well-tolerated with no serious
adverse events reported during the treatment and follow-up periods. A
greater number of adverse events were reported in the placebo arm than in
the treatment arm of the trial. There are no approved therapies specifically
for PPD and therapeutic options in severe PPD are limited.
  ""This is potentially one of the most important clinical findings in the
pharmacologic treatment of postpartum depression to date,"" said Samantha
Meltzer-Brody, M.D., M.P.H., Associate Professor and Director of the UNC
Perinatal Psychiatry Program of the UNC Center for Women's Mood Disorders
and primary investigator for the PPD-202 Trial. ""The rapid onset of action
of this drug observed in the trial is unlike anything else available in the
field to date. The data show the potential of the drug to provide relief
from the debilitating symptoms of PPD, and to markedly decrease suffering in
women who are severely affected.""
  This was a Phase 2, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 1:1
randomization trial that was designed to enroll up to 32 women. The
population studied were women with severe PPD (HAM-D >=26) who developed
severe depression either in the third trimester or within four weeks of
childbirth. At baseline, the mean HAM-D scores for both groups was greater
than 28. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the effect of
SAGE-547 on depression as measured by the HAM-D score, compared to placebo,
at 60 hours. In addition, patients were monitored during a 30-day follow-up
period to assess both safety and efficacy.
  ""These data speak for themselves. The unmet need in the PPD patient
population cannot be overstated. Given the societal impact of this
condition, and the possible identification of a biological basis for
treating these women, we are hopeful these data will point to a new
understanding of this disorder and the development of effective therapies""
said Jeff Jonas, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Sage. ""Further, as the
second positive placebo-controlled trial involving SAGE-547, the first being
in essential tremor, this demonstrates the potential broad utility of our
differentiated GABA mechanism and the candidate molecules in our pipeline,
not only for neurological disorders, but now for mood and affective
disorders as well. I am extremely proud of the great work from the Sage team
and we are thankful to our patients and investigators.""
  ""There has been a long-standing need to find an effective treatment option
for women with postpartum depression, not only to alleviate the suffering of
those women struggling with the disease, but to mitigate the effect on their
family and children. Based on our review of the literature, we believe these
data represent an unprecedented opportunity for developing treatments for
PPD, and believe that our findings will serve as a paradigm shift in how the
disease is thought about and, if our development program is successful, how
PPD might be treated in the future,"" said Steve Kanes, M.D., Ph.D., Chief
Medical Officer of Sage. ""The results of this study replicate and extend the
findings of our original, open-label probe study of PPD reported previously.
Given the consistent activity signals seen in both our open-label and
placebo-controlled trials, we also intend to examine the development
pathways for several of our other proprietary pipeline compounds into the
treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders, such as major depression,
bipolar disorder and panic disorder.""
  Secondary endpoints, including the Montgomery--&#197;sberg Depression Rating
Scale (MADRS), showed a similar pattern of significant difference (p=0.004)
at 24 hours and maintained to 30 days (p=0.01). MADRS total scores at
baseline were 37.5 and 37.0 for SAGE-547 and placebo groups, respectively.
At 60 hours post-initiation of treatment, the mean change from baseline in
MADRS total score for the SAGE-547 group was -27.9 compared with the placebo
group mean change of -12.2; this treatment difference of 15.7 points was
statistically significant (p=0.01). Presentation of more comprehensive data
from the trial is expected at future medical meetings and in publications.
  The company has initiated an expansion of this Phase 2 clinical program to
determine optimal dosing of SAGE-547 in PPD. This expanded trial involves
dose exploration in moderate as well as severe patients, in a multicenter,
placebo-controlled trial of SAGE-547 with enrollment to begin before the end
of the year. In addition, the company intends to move forward with a PPD
program involving its oral molecule, SAGE-217, and to seek regulatory input
to determine the appropriate pathways for developing both medications for
this indication.
  Summary of Top-line SAGE-547 Phase 2 Study Results
  Effect on Depressive Symptoms
   -- The 21 patients enrolled in the trial were required to have had a Major
      Depressive Episode that began no earlier than the third trimester and no


      later than the first four weeks following delivery, and to also be less
      than six months postpartum at the time of enrollment. Trial participants


      were also required to have a HAM-D score of 26 or above prior to
      treatment.


   -- Patients were randomized one-to-one to either SAGE-547 or placebo, and
      were administered blinded IV inpatient treatment as a continuous
infusion
      for 60 hours. Ten patients were randomized to SAGE-547 treatment, while
      11 patients were randomized to placebo. Patients were allowed to remain
      on background medications that could not be adjusted during treatment.
      Only three patients in each group were on such medications.


   -- The study was designed to titrate dosing based on body weight.
   -- SAGE-547 achieved the primary endpoint with a significant reduction in
      the HAM-D scale compared to placebo at 60 hours (p=0.008).


   -- SAGE-547 patients experienced a 19.0 point mean reduction in their HAM-D


      scores at 24 hours (p=0.006), achieving a greater than 10.6 point
      difference from placebo at that time point and was maintained at similar


      magnitude through to the 30-day follow-up (p=0.01).


   -- Results from secondary efficacy endpoints, including other rating scales


      such as the MADRS, reinforced the overall efficacy observed with
SAGE-547
      in the trial.


   -- Remission from depression, as determined by a HAM-D less than or equal
to
      7, measured at 60 hours, was seen in 7 of 10 SAGE-547 patients and 1 of
      11 placebo patients (p=0.008). The remission finding in the SAGE-547
      group was maintained out to 30 days (p=0.03), demonstrating a strong
      durability of effect from SAGE-547 for over three weeks following the
end
      of treatment.
  Safety and tolerability:
   -- SAGE-547 was generally well tolerated in this study. There were no
deaths,
      serious adverse events or discontinuations.


   -- Overall, fewer patients who received SAGE-547 experienced adverse events


      compared with placebo: 4 of 10 on SAGE-547 and 8 of 11 on placebo.


   -- Similar number of patients reported Nervous System Disorder Adverse
      Events: 3 of 10 on SAGE-547 and 4 of 11 on placebo.


   -- Equal number of patients reported the cluster of dizziness, sedation or
      somnolence: 3 in each group.


   -- Fewer SAGE-547 patients reported Psychiatric Disorder Adverse Events: 0
      of 10 on SAGE-547 and 5 of 11 on placebo. Adverse events included
      abnormal dreams, insomnia and anxiety for placebo.

  About the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)
","Sage Reports Positive Top-line Results Including Demonstration of 30-Day Durability from Phase 2 Clinical Trial of SAGE-547 in Severe Postpartum Depression   Primary endpoint achieved with statistical significance at 60 hours maintained through 30 days   70% remission achieved at 60 hours of SAGE-547 treatment and maintained at 30-day follow-up   Company expects to pursue further development of SAGE-547 and SAGE-217 for PPD in a global clinical program   Conference call scheduled for 8:00 AM ET today CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 12, 2016--   Sage Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SAGE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system disorders, today announced positive top-line results from its Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-547 for the treatment of severe postpartum depression (PPD). SAGE-547 achieved the primary endpoint of a significant reduction in the HAM-D score compared to placebo at 60 hours (p=0.008). This represented a greater than 20 point mean reduction in the depression scores of the SAGE-547 group at the primary endpoint of 60 hours through trial completion with a greater than 12 point difference from placebo. The statistically significant difference in treatment effect began at 24 hours, (p=0.006) with an effect that was maintained at similar magnitude through to the 30-day follow-up (p=0.01). Remission from depression, as determined by a HAM-D <=7, measured at 60 hours, was seen in 7 of 10 of the SAGE-547 group compared with 1 of 11 in the placebo group (p=0.008). Similarly, at 30 days, 7 of 10 of the SAGE-547 group and 2 of 11 in the placebo group were in remission (p=0.03). SAGE-547 was found to be generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported during the treatment and follow-up periods. A greater number of adverse events were reported in the placebo arm than in the treatment arm of the trial. There are no approved therapies specifically for PPD and therapeutic options in severe PPD are limited.   ""This is potentially one of the most important clinical findings in the pharmacologic treatment of postpartum depression to date,"" said Samantha Meltzer-Brody, M.D., M.P.H., Associate Professor and Director of the UNC Perinatal Psychiatry Program of the UNC Center for Women's Mood Disorders and primary investigator for the PPD-202 Trial. ""The rapid onset of action of this drug observed in the trial is unlike anything else available in the field to date. The data show the potential of the drug to provide relief from the debilitating symptoms of PPD, and to markedly decrease suffering in women who are severely affected.""   This was a Phase 2, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 1:1 randomization trial that was designed to enroll up to 32 women. The population studied were women with severe PPD (HAM-D >=26) who developed severe depression either in the third trimester or within four weeks of childbirth. At baseline, the mean HAM-D scores for both groups was greater than 28. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the effect of SAGE-547 on depression as measured by the HAM-D score, compared to placebo, at 60 hours. In addition, patients were monitored during a 30-day follow-up period to assess both safety and efficacy.   ""These data speak for themselves. The unmet need in the PPD patient population cannot be overstated. Given the societal impact of this condition, and the possible identification of a biological basis for treating these women, we are hopeful these data will point to a new understanding of this disorder and the development of effective therapies"" said Jeff Jonas, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Sage. ""Further, as the second positive placebo-controlled trial involving SAGE-547, the first being in essential tremor, this demonstrates the potential broad utility of our differentiated GABA mechanism and the candidate molecules in our pipeline, not only for neurological disorders, but now for mood and affective disorders as well. I am extremely proud of the great work from the Sage team and we are thankful to our patients and investigators.""   ""There has been a long-standing need to find an effective treatment option for women with postpartum depression, not only to alleviate the suffering of those women struggling with the disease, but to mitigate the effect on their family and children. Based on our review of the literature, we believe these data represent an unprecedented opportunity for developing treatments for PPD, and believe that our findings will serve as a paradigm shift in how the disease is thought about and, if our development program is successful, how PPD might be treated in the future,"" said Steve Kanes, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of Sage. ""The results of this study replicate and extend the findings of our original, open-label probe study of PPD reported previously. Given the consistent activity signals seen in both our open-label and placebo-controlled trials, we also intend to examine the development pathways for several of our other proprietary pipeline compounds into the treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders, such as major depression, bipolar disorder and panic disorder.""   Secondary endpoints, including the Montgomery--&#197;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), showed a similar pattern of significant difference (p=0.004) at 24 hours and maintained to 30 days (p=0.01). MADRS total scores at baseline were 37.5 and 37.0 for SAGE-547 and placebo groups, respectively. At 60 hours post-initiation of treatment, the mean change from baseline in MADRS total score for the SAGE-547 group was -27.9 compared with the placebo group mean change of -12.2; this treatment difference of 15.7 points was statistically significant (p=0.01).

PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 05, 2016--
  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) announced today that CheckMate -026,
a trial investigating the use of Opdivo (nivolumab) as monotherapy, did not
meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with
previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose
tumors expressed PD-L1 at >= 5%. The company will complete a full evaluation
of the CheckMate -026 data and work with investigators on the future
presentation of the results.
  Giovanni Caforio, M.D., chief executive officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb,
commented, ""Opdivo has become a foundational treatment that is transforming
cancer care across multiple tumor types. While we are disappointed CheckMate
-026 did not meet its primary endpoint in this broad patient population, we
remain committed to improving patient outcomes through our comprehensive
development program, including the ongoing Phase 3 CheckMate -227 study
exploring the potential of the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy for PD-L1
positive patients, and Opdivo plus Yervoy, or Opdivo plus chemotherapy in
PD-L1 negative patients.""
  About CheckMate -026
  CheckMate -026 is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized study of Opdivo as
monotherapy versus investigator's choice chemotherapy in patients with
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients enrolled in the trial
had received no prior systemic treatment for advanced disease and tested
positive for PD-L1 expression. The trial randomized 541 patients to receive
either Opdivo 3 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks or investigator's choice
chemotherapy in squamous patients (gemcitabine with cisplatin/gemcitabine
with carboplatin/paclitaxel with carboplatin) and non-squamous patients
(pemetrexed with cisplatin/pemetrexed with carboplatin) until disease
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of 6 cycles. The primary
endpoint is progression-free survival, as assessed by the Independent
Radiology Review Committee, in patients with >= 5% PD-L1 tumor expression.
  Bristol-Myers Squibb & Immuno-Oncology: Advancing Oncology Research
  At Bristol-Myers Squibb, we have a vision for the future of cancer care that
is focused on Immuno-Oncology, now considered a major treatment choice
alongside surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and targeted therapies for
certain types of cancer.
  We have a comprehensive clinical portfolio of investigational and approved
Immuno-Oncology agents, many of which were discovered and developed by our
scientists. Our ongoing Immuno-Oncology clinical program is looking at broad
patient populations, across multiple solid tumors and hematologic
malignancies, and lines of therapy and histologies, with the intent of
powering our trials for overall survival and other important measures like
durability of response. We pioneered the research leading to the first
regulatory approval for the combination of two Immuno-Oncology agents, and
continue to study the role of combinations in cancer.
  We are also investigating other immune system pathways in the treatment of
cancer including CTLA-4, CD-137, KIR, SLAMF7, PD-1, GITR, CSF1R, IDO and
LAG-3. These pathways may lead to potential new treatment options -- in
combination or monotherapy -- to help patients fight different types of
cancers.
  Our collaboration with academia, as well as small and large biotech
companies, to research the potential Immuno-Oncology and non-Immuno-Oncology
combinations, helps achieve our goal of providing new treatment options in
clinical practice.
  At Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are committed to changing survival expectations
in hard-to-treat cancers and the way patients live with cancer.
  About Opdivo
  Cancer cells may exploit ""regulatory"" pathways, such as checkpoint pathways,
to hide from the immune system and shield the tumor from immune attack.
Opdivo is a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor that binds to the checkpoint
receptor PD-1 expressed on activated T-cells, and blocks the binding of
PD-L1 and PD-L2, preventing the PD-1 pathway's suppressive signaling on the
immune system, including the interference with an anti-tumor immune
response.
  Opdivo's broad global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibb's
understanding of the biology behind Immuno-Oncology. Our company is at the
forefront of researching the potential of Immuno-Oncology to extend survival
in hard-to-treat cancers. This scientific expertise serves as the basis for
the Opdivo development program, which includes a broad range of Phase 3
clinical trials evaluating overall survival as the primary endpoint across a
variety of tumor types. The Opdivo trials have also contributed toward the
clinical and scientific understanding of the role of biomarkers and how
patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.
To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has enrolled more than
18,000 patients.
  Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory
approval anywhere in the world in July 2014, and currently has regulatory
approval in 54 countries including the United States, Japan and in the
European Union.

  IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
  WARNING: IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS
  YERVOY can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.
These immune- mediated reactions may involve any organ system; however, the
most common severe immune- mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis,
hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy,
and endocrinopathy. The majority of these immune-mediated reactions
initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to
months after discontinuation of YERVOY.
  Assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis,
neuropathy, and endocrinopathy and evaluate clinical chemistries including
liver function tests (LFTs), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and
thyroid function tests at baseline and before each dose.
  Permanently discontinue YERVOY and initiate systemic high-dose
corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions.
  Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
  Immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases, occurred with OPDIVO
treatment. Across the clinical trial experience with solid tumors, fatal
immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred with OPDIVO. In addition, in CheckMate
069, there were six patients who died without resolution of abnormal
respiratory findings. Monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging
and symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or
greater pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 and withhold
until resolution for Grade 2. In CheckMate 069 and 067, immune-mediated
pneumonitis occurred in 6% (25/407) of patients receiving OPDIVO with
YERVOY: Fatal (n=1), Grade 3 (n=6), Grade 2 (n=17), and Grade 1 (n=1). In
CheckMate 037, 066, and 067, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 1.8%
(14/787) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 3 (n=2) and Grade 2 (n=12). In
CheckMate 057, immune- mediated pneumonitis, including interstitial lung
disease, occurred in 3.4% (10/287) of patients: Grade 3 (n=5), Grade 2
(n=2), and Grade 1 (n=3). In CheckMate 025, pneumonitis, including
interstitial lung disease, occurred in 5% (21/406) of patients receiving
OPDIVO and 18% (73/397) of patients receiving everolimus. Immune-mediated
pneumonitis occurred in 4.4% (18/406) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 4
(n=1), Grade 3 (n=4), Grade 2 (n=12), and Grade 1 (n=1). In CheckMate 205
and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 4.9%
(13/263) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred
in 3.4% (9/263) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 3 (n=1) and Grade 2
(n=8).","Bristol-Myers Squibb Announces Top-Line Results from CheckMate -026, a Phase 3 Study of Opdivo (nivolumab) in Treatment-Na&#239;ve Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer   Opdivo did not meet trial primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients expressing PD-L1 >= 5% PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 05, 2016--   Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) announced today that CheckMate -026, a trial investigating the use of Opdivo (nivolumab) as monotherapy, did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at >= 5%.

Please refer to the end of the Important Safety Information for a brief description of the patient populations studied in the CheckMate trials.   IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION   WARNING: IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS   YERVOY can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune- mediated reactions may involve any organ system; however, the most common severe immune- mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. The majority of these immune-mediated reactions initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to months after discontinuation of YERVOY.   Assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy and evaluate clinical chemistries including liver function tests (LFTs), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function tests at baseline and before each dose.   Permanently discontinue YERVOY and initiate systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions.   Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis   Immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases, occurred with OPDIVO treatment. Across the clinical trial experience with solid tumors, fatal immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred with OPDIVO. In addition, in CheckMate 069, there were six patients who died without resolution of abnormal respiratory findings. Monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging and symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 and withhold until resolution for Grade 2. In CheckMate 069 and 067, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 6% (25/407) of patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY: Fatal (n=1), Grade 3 (n=6), Grade 2 (n=17), and Grade 1 (n=1). In CheckMate 037, 066, and 067, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 1.8% (14/787) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 3 (n=2) and Grade 2 (n=12). In CheckMate 057, immune- mediated pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 3.4% (10/287) of patients: Grade 3 (n=5), Grade 2 (n=2), and Grade 1 (n=3). In CheckMate 025, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 5% (21/406) of patients receiving OPDIVO and 18% (73/397) of patients receiving everolimus. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.4% (18/406) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 4 (n=1), Grade 3 (n=4), Grade 2 (n=12), and Grade 1 (n=1). In CheckMate 205 and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 4.9% (13/263) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (9/263) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 3 (n=1) and Grade 2 (n=8).",,-18%

Sparsentan in Patients with Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis
  Combined sparsentan treatment group experienced 44.8 percent reduction of
proteinuria, more than double the reduction of irbesartan; achieves
statistical significance in primary efficacy endpoint
  Preliminary safety findings show sparsentan was generally safe and
well-tolerated
  Conference call scheduled for today at 8:30 a.m. ET
  SAN DIEGO, Sept. 07, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Retrophin, Inc. (NASDAQ:RTRX)
today announced positive top-line results from the Phase 2 DUET study of
sparsentan for the treatment of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a
rare kidney disorder without an approved pharmacologic treatment that often
leads to end-stage renal disease. The study achieved statistical
significance in the primary efficacy endpoint for the overall sparsentan
treatment group, demonstrating a greater than two-fold reduction of
proteinuria compared to irbesartan after the eight-week, double-blind
treatment period.
  ""We are very pleased with the robust top-line results from DUET, which
suggest sparsentan could be a significant advancement in the treatment of
FSGS,"" said Stephen Aselage, chief executive officer of Retrophin. ""FSGS
patients today face poor outcomes with limited medical options; we look
forward to working with the FDA to find the most expeditious path forward
that would deliver the first approved pharmacologic treatment to the FSGS
community.""
  In the DUET study, the mean reduction of proteinuria from baseline after
eight weeks of treatment for all patients treated with 200, 400, and 800
mg/day of sparsentan (n=64) was 44.8 percent, compared to a mean reduction
of proteinuria for all patients receiving 300 mg/day of irbesartan (n=32) of
18.5 percent (p=0.006). Further, the mean reduction of proteinuria from
baseline after eight weeks of treatment for all patients treated with 400 mg
and 800 mg doses of sparsentan (n=51) was 47.4 percent, compared to a mean
proteinuria reduction of 19.0 percent for patients receiving 300 mg of
irbesartan (n=25) in these two dose cohorts (p=0.011). The comparison of
individual sparsentan dose cohorts to irbesartan showed clear signals of
relative improvement, but did not reach statistical significance.
  ""The results from DUET serve as proof of concept for sparsentan's novel
approach of combining endothelin receptor type A blockade with angiotensin
II inhibition for the treatment of FSGS,"" said Alvin Shih, M.D., executive
vice president and head of research & development for Retrophin.
""Significant reductions in proteinuria, along with a well-tolerated
preliminary safety profile have us excited about being one step closer to
providing a new treatment option for patients with FSGS.""
  Top-line results suggest sparsentan was generally safe and well-tolerated in
the DUET study. One serious adverse event, anemia, classified as potentially
related to treatment occurred in the sparsentan group but did not result in
study discontinuation during the eight-week blinded treatment period. There
were no withdrawals due to fluid retention during the eight-week blinded
treatment period. All patients who completed the eight-week treatment period
entered the ongoing open label extension study, and the vast majority of
these patients continue to receive therapy.
  The Company plans to present detailed study results, including data from the
open label extension, at an upcoming medical meeting or in a peer-reviewed
publication.

  About the DUET Study
  The DUET study is an international, randomized, double-blind, Phase 2
clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of sparsentan in 109
patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), of which 96
qualified for the evaluable database. The primary endpoint is the reduction
of proteinuria, as compared to irbesartan, which is part of a class of drugs
used to manage FSGS in the absence of an approved pharmacologic treatment.
After a two-week washout period, patients were randomized to receive daily
oral doses of 200 mg, 400 mg, and 800 mg of sparsentan or 300 mg of
irbesartan. After completing the eight-week treatment period, all patients
were eligible to receive sparsentan as part of the study's open-label
extension.
  About Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)
  Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, is a rare disorder without an
approved pharmacologic treatment option that is estimated to affect up to
40,000 patients in the U.S. with similar prevalence in Europe. The disorder
is defined by progressive scarring of the kidney and often leads to
end-stage renal disease. FSGS is characterized by proteinuria, where protein
is found in the urine due to a breakdown of the normal filtration mechanism
in the kidney. Other common symptoms include swelling in parts of the body
known as edema, as well as low blood albumin levels, abnormal lipid
profiles, and hypertension.
  Reduction in proteinuria is widely regarded to be beneficial in the
treatment of FSGS, and may be associated with a decreased risk of
progression to end-stage renal disease. In the absence of an approved
pharmacologic treatment, FSGS patients are currently managed with
angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,
calcineurin inhibitors, and steroids.
  About Sparsentan
  Sparsentan could be the first approved pharmacologic treatment for focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, a rare kidney disorder that often
leads to end-stage renal disease. Sparsentan's dual mechanism of action
combines angiotensin receptor blockade with endothelin receptor type A
blockade. In several forms of chronic kidney disease, endothelin receptor
blockade has been shown to have an additive beneficial effect on proteinuria
in combination with renin-angiotensin blockade via angiotensin receptor
blockade or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
  The Phase 2 DUET study of sparsentan met the primary efficacy endpoint for
the overall treatment group, demonstrating a greater than two-fold reduction
of proteinuria compared to irbesartan, after the eight-week, double-blind
treatment period. The Company plans to engage the FDA to determine the most
expeditious path forward to advance the development of sparsentan towards
approval. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European
Commission each granted sparsentan orphan drug designation for the treatment
of FSGS.

  First Successful Phase 3 Trial of an Oral Anti-diabetic for Type 1 Diabetes
  Conference call and webcast September 9, 2016 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time
  PR Newswire
  THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Sept. 9, 2016
  THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Sept. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Lexicon Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (Nasdaq: LXRX) announced today that the pivotal inTandem1 Phase 3
clinical trial of sotagliflozin met its primary endpoint, showing a
statistically significant reduction in A1C at 24 weeks in patients with type
1 diabetes on a background of optimized insulin.
  Top-line results from the Phase 3 study showed that patients treated with
sotagliflozin had a mean A1C reduction from baseline of 0.43% on 200mg once
daily sotagliflozin dose (p<0.001) and a reduction of 0.49% on 400mg once
daily sotagliflozin dose (p<0.001) as compared to a reduction of 0.08% on
placebo after 24 weeks of treatment, meeting the study's primary endpoint.
This statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in A1C
for both doses of sotagliflozin was achieved without an increase in severe
hypoglycemia, one of the most prevalent serious health challenges in type 1
diabetes, which was seen less frequently in both treatment arms than
placebo.
  ""We are extremely pleased with these top-line results and the potential
long-term benefits that sotagliflozin may bring to people with type 1
diabetes,"" said Lexicon President and Chief Executive Officer Lonnel Coats.
""We believe these results provide evidence that sotagliflozin, with its
novel dual inhibition of both SGLT-1 and SGLT-2, is particularly well suited
to help these individuals achieve better A1C levels without increasing and
possibly reducing the risk of severe hypoglycemia.""
  ""Our companies are working together to develop this compound for the
treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes,"" said Jorge Insuasty, Senior Vice
President, Head of Global Development, Sanofi.  ""These top-line results
highlight potential benefits of sotagliflozin when treating adults with type
1 diabetes.  We congratulate our partners on this positive outcome and look
forward to further exploring this compound for the treatment of adults with
type 2 diabetes when Sanofi begins the Phase 3 program later this year.""
  ""The inTandem1 study is part of the largest Phase 3 program for an oral
anti-diabetic agent in type 1 diabetes to date,"" said Anne Peters, M.D.,
Professor of Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, Director of the
USC Clinical Diabetes Programs and Chairman of the Sotagliflozin Type 1
Diabetes Steering Committee.  ""Sotagliflozin demonstrated compelling,
significant and clinically meaningful A1C reduction with no increase in
severe hypoglycemia and a slight risk of DKA.  If approved, sotagliflozin
could represent a significant addition to the current standard of care and
potentially allow patients with type 1 diabetes to better manage their
diabetes while on insulin.""
  About inTandem1
  The double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase 3 study known as inTandem1
enrolled 793 patients in the United States and Canada with type 1 diabetes
on insulin pump or multiple daily injection therapy who had an A1C level
entering the study between 7.0% and 11.0%, which corresponds to an estimated
average blood sugar of 154 mg/dl to 269 mg/dl (8.6 mmol/l to 15.0 mmol/l).
The three-arm study evaluated two doses of sotagliflozin, 200mg and 400mg,
each taken once daily before the first meal of the day, against placebo.
Prior to randomization, insulin was optimized for all patients over a
six-week period, with the objective of improving glycemic control using
insulin alone.  After completion of this optimization period, patients were
maintained on optimized insulin and randomized to one of two doses of
sotagliflozin or placebo, and their baseline, post-optimization A1C was
measured.  The mean baseline A1C level at the time of randomization after
the six-week optimization period was 7.6% for all three dose arms.
  The primary endpoint of the study was change in A1C from baseline after a
24-week period of treatment.  The trial has a double-blind long term
extension of 28-weeks, with a total treatment duration of 52-weeks. There
were 268 patients in the placebo arm, 263 patients in the 200mg dose arm and
262 patients in the 400mg dose arm.  The overall mean placebo adjusted A1C
reduction was 0.35% in the 200mg dose arm (p<0.001) and 0.41% in the 400mg
dose arm (p<0.001).
  Sotagliflozin was generally well tolerated.  Across all three dose arms
(placebo, 200mg, 400mg), the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events
(AEs) were 67.5%, 67.3% and 71.0%, respectively; the incidence of serious
AEs (SAEs) were 3.4%, 3.8% and 6.9%, respectively; and discontinuation due
to AEs were 1.5%, 1.1% and 3.8%, respectively. There were no reported deaths
in the study.
  Two primary safety concerns for patients with type 1 diabetes are severe
hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  The number of patients with
severe hypoglycemic events during the 24-week treatment period was 18
(6.7%), 11 (4.2%), and 12 (4.6%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms,
respectively.  The number of patients with DKA events during the 24-week
treatment period was 0 (0.0%), 3 (1.1%), and 8 (3.1%) in the placebo, 200mg
and 400mg dose arms, respectively.
  Lexicon is conducting another similar pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial
predominantly in Europe (inTandem2), which is expected to report top-line
results by the end of the year.  The third type 1 diabetes Phase 3 clinical
trial, inTandem3, is underway globally and is studying approximately 1,400
patients treated with sotagliflozin 400mg once daily or placebo on a
background of any insulin therapy, but without insulin optimization prior to
randomization. Sanofi is expected to commence Phase 3 clinical trials for
sotagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes by the end of the year.
  About Sotagliflozin
  Discovered using Lexicon's unique approach to gene science, sotagliflozin is
a first-in-class, oral dual inhibitor of two proteins responsible for
glucose regulation known as sodium-glucose co-transporter types 1 and 2
(SGLT1 and SGLT2). SGLT1 is responsible for glucose absorption in the
gastrointestinal tract, and SGLT2 is responsible for glucose reabsorption by
the kidney. Sotagliflozin has been shown in a Phase 2 study to improve
glycemic control in people with type 1 diabetes while reducing their need
for mealtime insulin.
  Lexicon entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi in
November 2015 under which Lexicon granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-bearing right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize
sotagliflozin.  Lexicon is responsible for all clinical development
activities relating to type 1 diabetes and retains an exclusive option to
co-promote and have a significant role, in collaboration with Sanofi, in the
commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in
the United States.  Sanofi is responsible for all clinical development and
commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
worldwide and is solely responsible for the commercialization of
sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes outside the United
States.

(Nasdaq: LXRX) announced today that the pivotal inTandem1 Phase 3 clinical trial of sotagliflozin met its primary endpoint, showing a statistically significant reduction in A1C at 24 weeks in patients with type 1 diabetes on a background of optimized insulin.   Top-line results from the Phase 3 study showed that patients treated with sotagliflozin had a mean A1C reduction from baseline of 0.43% on 200mg once daily sotagliflozin dose (p<0.001) and a reduction of 0.49% on 400mg once daily sotagliflozin dose (p<0.001) as compared to a reduction of 0.08% on placebo after 24 weeks of treatment, meeting the study's primary endpoint. This statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in A1C for both doses of sotagliflozin was achieved without an increase in severe hypoglycemia, one of the most prevalent serious health challenges in type 1 diabetes, which was seen less frequently in both treatment arms than placebo.   ""We are extremely pleased with these top-line results and the potential long-term benefits that sotagliflozin may bring to people with type 1 diabetes,"" said Lexicon President and Chief Executive Officer Lonnel Coats. ""We believe these results provide evidence that sotagliflozin, with its novel dual inhibition of both SGLT-1 and SGLT-2, is particularly well suited to help these individuals achieve better A1C levels without increasing and possibly reducing the risk of severe hypoglycemia.""   ""Our companies are working together to develop this compound for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes,"" said Jorge Insuasty, Senior Vice President, Head of Global Development, Sanofi.  ""These top-line results highlight potential benefits of sotagliflozin when treating adults with type 1 diabetes.  We congratulate our partners on this positive outcome and look forward to further exploring this compound for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes when Sanofi begins the Phase 3 program later this year.""   ""The inTandem1 study is part of the largest Phase 3 program for an oral anti-diabetic agent in type 1 diabetes to date,"" said Anne Peters, M.D., Professor of Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Programs and Chairman of the Sotagliflozin Type 1 Diabetes Steering Committee.  ""Sotagliflozin demonstrated compelling, significant and clinically meaningful A1C reduction with no increase in severe hypoglycemia and a slight risk of DKA.  If approved, sotagliflozin could represent a significant addition to the current standard of care and potentially allow patients with type 1 diabetes to better manage their diabetes while on insulin.""   About inTandem1   The double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase 3 study known as inTandem1 enrolled 793 patients in the United States and Canada with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump or multiple daily injection therapy who had an A1C level entering the study between 7.0% and 11.0%, which corresponds to an estimated average blood sugar of 154 mg/dl to 269 mg/dl (8.6 mmol/l to 15.0 mmol/l). The three-arm study evaluated two doses of sotagliflozin, 200mg and 400mg, each taken once daily before the first meal of the day, against placebo. Prior to randomization, insulin was optimized for all patients over a six-week period, with the objective of improving glycemic control using insulin alone.  After completion of this optimization period, patients were maintained on optimized insulin and randomized to one of two doses of sotagliflozin or placebo, and their baseline, post-optimization A1C was measured.  The mean baseline A1C level at the time of randomization after the six-week optimization period was 7.6% for all three dose arms.   The primary endpoint of the study was change in A1C from baseline after a 24-week period of treatment.  The trial has a double-blind long term extension of 28-weeks, with a total treatment duration of 52-weeks. There were 268 patients in the placebo arm, 263 patients in the 200mg dose arm and 262 patients in the 400mg dose arm.  The overall mean placebo adjusted A1C reduction was 0.35% in the 200mg dose arm (p<0.001) and 0.41% in the 400mg dose arm (p<0.001).   Sotagliflozin was generally well tolerated.  Across all three dose arms (placebo, 200mg, 400mg), the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were 67.5%, 67.3% and 71.0%, respectively; the incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) were 3.4%, 3.8% and 6.9%, respectively; and discontinuation due to AEs were 1.5%, 1.1% and 3.8%, respectively. There were no reported deaths in the study.   Two primary safety concerns for patients with type 1 diabetes are severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  The number of patients with severe hypoglycemic events during the 24-week treatment period was 18 (6.7%), 11 (4.2%), and 12 (4.6%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms, respectively.  The number of patients with DKA events during the 24-week treatment period was 0 (0.0%), 3 (1.1%), and 8 (3.1%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms, respectively.   Lexicon is conducting another similar pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial predominantly in Europe (inTandem2), which is expected to report top-line results by the end of the year.  The third type 1 diabetes Phase 3 clinical trial, inTandem3, is underway globally and is studying approximately 1,400 patients treated with sotagliflozin 400mg once daily or placebo on a background of any insulin therapy, but without insulin optimization prior to randomization.

RoclatanTM Successfully Achieves Primary Efficacy Endpoint in Mercury 1 Study

Conference Call and Webcast Today, September 14, at 5:00 p.m. ET

Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AERI), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of glaucoma and other diseases of the eye, today reported the successful 90-day primary efficacy results of its 12-month Phase 3 “Mercury 1” clinical trial for its fixed-dose combination product candidate, RoclatanTM. The study achieved its primary efficacy endpoint demonstrating statistical superiority over each of its components, including Aerie product candidate RhopressaTM (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02%, and market leading prostaglandin analogue (PGA) latanoprost, all of which were dosed once daily in the evening. The study evaluated patients with maximum baseline intraocular pressures (IOPs) ranging from above 20 to below 36 mmHg (millimeters of mercury). The IOP-lowering effect of RoclatanTM was 1 to 3 mmHg greater than monotherapy with either latanoprost or RhopressaTM throughout the duration of the study. Management will host a conference call with accompanying slides to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. ET today. The accompanying slides are available at Aerie’s web site, aeriepharma.com.

RoclatanTM Phase 3 Highlights for Mercury 1

RoclatanTM dosed once daily achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating statistical superiority over both latanoprost and RhopressaTM at the primary endpoint range of baseline IOPs from above 20 to below 36 mmHg for each of the nine measured time points.
IOPs were measured at 8 a.m., 10 a.m., and 4 p.m. at week 2, week 6, and day 90. RoclatanTM IOP lowering exceeded that of latanoprost in a range of 1.3 to 2.5 mmHg, and exceeded RhopressaTM IOP lowering in a range of 1.8 to 3.0 mmHg. Efficacy levels were consistent across the 90-day period for all arms in the study.
RoclatanTM mean diurnal IOP-lowering exceeded that of latanoprost by an average across the study duration of 1.9 mmHg and exceeded RhopressaTM by 2.6 mmHg.
RoclatanTM reduced mean diurnal IOPs to 16 mmHg or lower in 61 percent of patients, a significantly higher percentage than observed in the comparator arms.
The most common RoclatanTM adverse event was hyperemia, or eye redness, which was reported in approximately 50 percent of patients, or 30 percent above baseline, and was scored as mild for the large majority of these patients. There were no drug-related serious adverse events for any of the comparators in the trial.
Aerie will hold an “Investor Day” in New York City on October 5, 2016 to cover further details from the Mercury 1 trial and to provide a general business update.
“We are very pleased by these RoclatanTM 90-day efficacy results from the Mercury 1 clinical trial. As expected, the topline efficacy demonstrated in this trial clearly reconfirms the potential for RoclatanTM to become the most efficacious IOP-lowering therapy to enter the market, if approved. If Mercury 1 and 2 are successful, we expect to file the NDA for RoclatanTM near year-end 2017,” said Vicente Anido, Jr., Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Aerie.

Dr. Anido continued, “We also noted that the RhopressaTM arm demonstrated high levels of efficacy across the full range of baseline IOPs studied, and the efficacy was maintained for the 90-day period. Importantly, RhopressaTM demonstrated comparable levels of IOP lowering to latanoprost at baseline IOPs ranging from 20 to 25 mmHg in Mercury 1. This performance for RhopressaTM is consistent with levels observed in the previous Phase 2b trials for RhopressaTM and RoclatanTM.”

Richard A. Lewis, M.D., Aerie’s Chief Medical Officer added, “Once-daily RoclatanTM has shown a degree of IOP lowering in Mercury 1 that is quite impressive, especially when considering its ability to bring patient pressures down to levels as low as 8 to 14 mmHg. The safety profile of RoclatanTM observed thus far in Mercury 1 points to a safe and tolerable product.”

About RoclatanTM

RoclatanTM is a once-daily eye drop that combines RhopressaTM, as described below, with latanoprost, a PGA that is the most widely prescribed glaucoma drug in the world. Based on our preclinical studies and clinical trials, we believe that RoclatanTM, if approved, would be the first glaucoma product to lower IOP through all known mechanisms: (i) increasing fluid outflow through the trabecular meshwork, the eye’s primary drain, (ii) increasing fluid outflow through the uveoscleral pathway, the eye’s secondary drain, (iii) reducing fluid production in the eye, and (iv) reducing episcleral venous pressure (EVP). By covering the full spectrum of known IOP-lowering mechanisms, RoclatanTM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-lowering effect than any currently approved glaucoma product.

The first Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named Mercury 1 is a 12-month safety trial in 718 patients with a 90-day efficacy readout, which is the subject of this press release. The topline efficacy readout demonstrated that RoclatanTM was statistically superior to each of its components. The second Phase 3 registration trial, named Mercury 2, is a 90-day efficacy trial that commenced in March 2016, and a third Phase 3 registration trial, named Mercury 3, is expected to commence in Europe in the first half of 2017. Mercury 3 is not necessary for approval in the U.S., but rather to facilitate regulatory approval and commercialization in Europe.

About RhopressaTM

RhopressaTM (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02%, is a novel eye drop that we believe, if approved, would become the only once-daily product available that, based on Aerie’s preclinical studies, specifically targets the trabecular meshwork, the eye’s primary fluid drain and the diseased tissue responsible for elevated IOP in glaucoma. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated that RhopressaTM lowers episcleral venous pressure, which contributes approximately half of IOP in healthy subjects. Further, based on Aerie’s preclinical studies, RhopressaTM provides an additional mechanism that reduces fluid production in the eye and therefore lowers IOP. Biochemically, RhopressaTM has been shown in Aerie studies to inhibit both Rho Kinase (ROCK) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). Recent preclinical studies have also shown that RhopressaTM may have disease-modifying properties, including an anti-fibrotic effect on the trabecular meshwork and the potential to increase perfusion of the trabecular meshwork. Preclinical research is also currently underway to evaluate the potential neuroprotective benefits of RhopressaTM.

The results of two Phase 3 registration trials (Rocket 2 and Rocket 1) for RhopressaTM were included in a NDA filing submitted to the FDA in the third quarter of 2016. Rocket 2 represents the pivotal trial, and Rocket 1 is supportive. There are two additional Phase 3 trials currently underway for RhopressaTM, named Rocket 3 and Rocket 4. Rocket 3 is a 12-month safety-only study in Canada that is not needed for the NDA filing. Rocket 4 is designed to provide adequate six-month safety data for regulatory filing purposes in Europe, and is also not needed for the NDA filing.

  SAN DIEGO, Sept. 20, 2016
  SAN DIEGO, Sept. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mast Therapeutics, Inc. (NYSE MKT:
MSTX), a biopharmaceutical company developing novel, clinical-stage
therapies for sickle cell disease and heart failure, today reported top-line
results from EPIC, a Phase 3 clinical study of its investigational new drug
vepoloxamer (also known as MST-188) for the treatment of individuals with
sickle cell disease experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC).  The study did
not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating a statistically
significant reduction in the mean duration of VOC (82 hours in the
vepoloxamer group compared to 78 hours in the placebo group in the
intent-to-treat population (p=0.09)).  There were no statistically
significant differences between treatment groups in the intent-to-treat
population across the two secondary efficacy endpoints, rate of
re-hospitalization for VOC and the occurrence of acute chest syndrome.
Consistent with previously conducted studies, vepoloxamer was generally well
tolerated with no statistically significant differences in treatment-related
serious adverse events in the vepoloxamer group compared to the placebo
group. No deaths occurred on the study.
  ""We are exceedingly disappointed with these top-line results. While clearly
not the outcome we wanted, we believe the insights and data from the largest
placebo-controlled clinical trial ever completed in sickle cell disease will
substantially advance the understanding of vaso-occlusive crisis and the
still maturing clinical science necessary to support the development of new
therapeutics for this debilitating disease,"" stated Brian M. Culley, the
Company's Chief Executive Officer. ""We wish to reiterate our sincere
appreciation for all of the patients, caregivers, and others who aided us in
conducting this informative study.""
  ""These analyses are limited to just top-line data, so in the coming weeks
the Company intends to review the full data set from EPIC. In addition, we
plan to perform an interim analysis of the ongoing heart failure trial of
vepoloxamer. However, based on the data we've seen to date, we expect we
will terminate all clinical development of vepoloxamer. Consequently, while
we evaluate our options, we intend to significantly and immediately reduce
our operating expenses and continue our efforts with AIR001, our lead asset
in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which currently is the
subject of a 100-patient phase 2 study expected to complete enrollment by
the end of 2017,"" continued Mr. Culley.

  About the EPIC Study
  The EPIC study was a randomized, double-blind, two-arm, placebo-controlled,
Phase 3 clinical trial of vepoloxamer in individuals with sickle cell
disease hospitalized for acute pain typical of vaso-occlusive crisis who
required treatment with parenteral opioid analgesia. The primary objective
of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of vepoloxamer in reducing the
duration of vaso-occlusive crisis, with the duration of crisis measured from
the time of randomization to the time at which the patient received the last
dose of parenteral opioid analgesia for the treatment of vaso-occlusive
crisis prior to hospital discharge.  Vepoloxamer or placebo (0.45% saline)
was administered intravenously as a 1 hour loading dose infusion (100
mg/kg), immediately followed by a continuous maintenance infusion (30
mg/kg/hr) for at least 12 hours and up to 48 hours.  Randomization was
stratified by age (>=4 to <16 years or >=16 to <=65 years), use of
hydroxyurea (yes or no), and pain score (measured using the Wong-Baker
FACES(R) Pain Rating Scale at time of randomization: <8 or >=8). The study
was 90% powered to detect a 17% (16-hour) difference in treatment arms, with
a statistical significance level of p=0.05 (assuming an average crisis
duration of 96 hours in the control arm and a coefficient of variation >
50%).  Secondary efficacy endpoints were to compare the rates of
re-hospitalization for vaso-occlusive crisis within 14 days of initial
hospital discharge and the occurrence of acute chest syndrome within 120
hours of randomization between the treatment and control groups.
  A total of 388 patients, ages four to 46, were randomized in EPIC.  More
than 75 study sites in 14 countries participated.  The average age was 15
years.  Patients under age 18 accounted for approximately 71% of total
subjects.  Approximately 61% of patients were concurrently on hydroxyurea
therapy.
  About Sickle Cell Disease and Vaso-Occlusive Crisis
  Sickle cell disease is a chronic, genetic blood disorder that affects
millions worldwide and an estimated 100,000 people in the United States,
where it is classified as a rare, or orphan, disease.  The hallmark of
sickle cell disease is vaso-occlusive crisis, which results from obstruction
of blood vessels by sickled red blood cells causing tissue ischemia and
injury.  Vaso-occlusions can occur everywhere blood flows and lead to an
accumulating disease burden in every organ system with the ultimate loss of
vital organ function and significantly reduced lifespan.  Vaso-occlusive
crisis is also characterized by intense and debilitating pain which can last
for days and even weeks.  There are between 80,000 to 100,000
hospitalizations annually in the U.S. related to vaso-occlusive crisis and
no FDA approved treatment to shorten its duration or reduce the risk of
ischemic injury related to crisis.

  Company Plans to Present Additional Data at Upcoming Scientific Meeting
SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 26, 2016--
  Kite Pharma, Inc., (Nasdaq:KITE) today announced positive topline results
from a pre-planned interim analysis of ZUMA-1 for its lead product
candidate, KTE-C19, in patients with chemorefractory diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL). KTE-C19 met the primary endpoint of objective response
rate (ORR), p<0.0001, with ORR of 76 percent, including 47 percent complete
remissions (CR).
  ZUMA-1 enrolled patients with chemorefractory aggressive NHL into two
cohorts. Cohort 1 included patients with DLBCL, and Cohort 2 enrolled
patients with transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) and primary mediastinal
B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). Kite's intent is to seek regulatory approval of
KTE-C19 in DLBCL, TFL and PMBCL based upon the combined data of both
cohorts.
  The interim analysis of ZUMA-1 evaluated the ORR in the first 51 patients in
Cohort 1 with at least three months of follow-up. This analysis also
included an additional 11 patients in Cohort 2. The table below summarizes
the response rates from this interim analysis together with the previously
reported results from the Phase 1 portion of ZUMA-1 (Neelapu ASCO 2016).

  Across the combined 62 patients, the most common grade 3 or higher adverse
events included neutropenia (66 percent), anemia (40 percent), febrile
neutropenia (29 percent), thrombocytopenia (29 percent), and encephalopathy
(26 percent). Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and
neurological toxicity was observed in 18 percent and 34 percent of patients,
respectively. Two patients died from KTE-C19 related adverse events
(hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cardiac arrest in the setting of
CRS).
  The Phase 2 interim outcomes in ZUMA-1 are largely consistent with results
from the Phase 1 portion of the study and the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) study based on the same CAR construct, a low-dose
cyclophosphamide-fludaribine conditioning regimen, and Kite's proprietary
manufacturing process (Kochenderfer ASCO 2016).
  ""ZUMA-1 enrolled patients with chemorefractory aggressive NHL, a disease
that is very difficult to treat. The combined CR rate of 39 percent at three
months is very exciting as it represents nearly a five-fold increase from
the CR rate of 8 percent seen in the SCHOLAR-1 study in a similar patient
population,"" said Jeff Wiezorek, M.D., Senior Vice President of Clinical
Development. ""ZUMA-1 is the largest CAR-T study reported in NHL. We were
able to manufacture KTE-C19 for 99 percent of patients enrolled in the
study, and successfully handle the study logistics and adverse event
management at over 20 sites, most of which had no prior experience in CAR-T
therapy.""
  Additional data from this interim analysis will be submitted for
presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting. The primary analysis of 101
patients with chemorefractory aggressive NHL (DLBCL, TFL and PMBCL) will
include approximately six months of follow-up and is expected in the first
quarter of 2017.
  ""We are grateful to the study participants and investigators who have made
this important research possible. What started at the NCI over a decade ago
with the pioneering work of Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., has evolved
into a technology that has the potential to fundamentally change the outlook
of patients with cancer. For patients with aggressive NHL, every day matters
and a new treatment option like KTE-C19 is desperately needed,"" said Arie
Belldegrun, M.D., FACS, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Kite. ""I am proud of what we have achieved to date and excited to apply our
advanced learnings from ZUMA-1 to our ongoing clinical development programs
to bring continued innovation to patients and the scientific community at
large.""
  ZUMA-1 is supported in part by funding from The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society
(LLS) Therapy Acceleration Program(R) .

Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurological toxicity was observed in 18 percent and 34 percent of patients, respectively. Two patients died from KTE-C19 related adverse events (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cardiac arrest in the setting of CRS).   The Phase 2 interim outcomes in ZUMA-1 are largely consistent with results from the Phase 1 portion of the study and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) study based on the same CAR construct, a low-dose cyclophosphamide-fludaribine conditioning regimen, and Kite's proprietary manufacturing process (Kochenderfer ASCO 2016).   ""ZUMA-1 enrolled patients with chemorefractory aggressive NHL, a disease that is very difficult to treat. The combined CR rate of 39 percent at three months is very exciting as it represents nearly a five-fold increase from the CR rate of 8 percent seen in the SCHOLAR-1 study in a similar patient population,"" said Jeff Wiezorek, M.D., Senior Vice President of Clinical Development. ""ZUMA-1 is the largest CAR-T study reported in NHL. We were able to manufacture KTE-C19 for 99 percent of patients enrolled in the study, and successfully handle the study logistics and adverse event management at over 20 sites, most of which had no prior experience in CAR-T therapy.""   Additional data from this interim analysis will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting. The primary analysis of 101 patients with chemorefractory aggressive NHL (DLBCL, TFL and PMBCL) will include approximately six months of follow-up and is expected in the first quarter of 2017.   ""We are grateful to the study participants and investigators who have made this important research possible. What started at the NCI over a decade ago with the pioneering work of Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., has evolved into a technology that has the potential to fundamentally change the outlook of patients with cancer. For patients with aggressive NHL, every day matters and a new treatment option like KTE-C19 is desperately needed,"" said Arie Belldegrun, M.D., FACS, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kite. ""I am proud of what we have achieved to date and excited to apply our advanced learnings from ZUMA-1 to our ongoing clinical development programs to bring continued innovation to patients and the scientific community at large.""   ZUMA-1 is supported in part by funding from The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) Therapy Acceleration Program(R) .

  LONDON, Sept. 26, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GW Pharmaceuticals plc
(Nasdaq:GWPH) (AIM:GWP) (""GW,"" ""the Company"" or ""the Group""), a
biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and
commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product
platform, announces positive results of the second randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of its investigational medicine
Epidiolex(R) (cannabidiol or CBD) for the treatment of seizures associated
with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a rare and severe form of
childhood-onset epilepsy. In this trial, Epidiolex, when added to the
patient's current treatment, achieved the primary endpoint for both dose
levels with high statistical significance. During the treatment period,
patients taking Epidiolex 20mg/kg/day achieved a median reduction in monthly
drop seizures of 42 percent compared with a reduction of 17 percent in
patients taking placebo (p=0.0047), and patients taking Epidiolex
10mg/kg/day achieved a median reduction in monthly drop seizures of 37
percent compared with a reduction of 17 percent in patients taking placebo
(p=0.0016).
  This trial follows the announcement in June 2016 of positive results in the
first pivotal Phase 3 trial of Epidiolex for the treatment of seizures
associated with LGS, and the March 2016 announcement of positive results in
the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome.  GW expects to
submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration
(FDA) in the first half of 2017.
  ""The positive outcome in this second trial of Epidiolex in patients with
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome demonstrates the effectiveness of this product in
this particularly difficult to treat, childhood-onset epilepsy,"" stated
Orrin Devinsky, M.D., of New York University Langone Medical Center's
Comprehensive Epilepsy Center and principal investigator in the trial. ""The
data from the Epidiolex Dravet and LGS studies offers the prospect of an
FDA-approved CBD medicine that shows both clinically meaningful seizure
reduction and a consistent safety and tolerability profile. I believe
Epidiolex has the potential to become an important new option within the
field of treatment-resistant epilepsy.""
  ""Today brings great news for the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome community,"" said
Christina SanInocencio, Executive Director of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
Foundation. ""The announcement of a second set of positive results with
Epidiolex is exciting as they offer much needed hope for patients and their
families living with this debilitating condition where new treatment options
are desperately needed.""
  ""The Epilepsy Foundation is thrilled to learn about the recent preliminary
results for an innovative new therapy from GW for LGS. LGS in so many cases
is extremely difficult to treat, and is an incredible challenge for children
and families. We feel a tremendous sense of urgency to stop seizures, and
believe that the pursuit of new therapies offers hope to individuals who
have no currently available therapy to effectively stop their seizures. The
Epilepsy Foundation will continue to be a champion for GW's efforts to
pursue this innovative new therapy as studies progress. We thank GW and all
our partners who invest in a better tomorrow for people with epilepsy,""
stated Philip Gattone, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Epilepsy
Foundation.
  ""We are very pleased to report this second positive Phase 3 trial in
seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. This is the third positive
Phase 3 trial for Epidiolex reported in 2016. All three trials provide GW
with robust evidence to support the efficacy and safety of Epidiolex. This
latest trial also shows that Epidiolex likely has an effective dose range,
allowing for dose flexibility to address individual patient needs. These
compelling results make us more determined than ever to make this important
new medicine available to patients who suffer from these treatment-resistant
childhood-onset epilepsies,"" stated Justin Gover, GW's Chief Executive
Officer.
  Trial Overview and Result
  Patients aged 2-55 years with a confirmed diagnosis of drug-resistant LGS
currently uncontrolled on one or more concomitant anti-epileptic drugs
(AEDs) were eligible to participate in this Phase 3, randomized,
double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The trial randomized 225 patients
into three arms, where Epidiolex 20mg/kg/day (n=76), Epidiolex 10mg/kg/day
(n=73) or placebo (n=76) was added to current AED treatment. On average,
patients were taking approximately three AEDs, having previously tried and
discontinued an average of seven other AEDs. The average age of trial
participants was 16 years (30 percent were 18 years or older). The median
drop seizure frequency over the 4 week baseline period was 85.
  The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial was a comparison between
Epidiolex and placebo in the percentage change in the monthly frequency of
drop seizures during the 14 week treatment period (two week dose escalation
period followed by 12 weeks of maintenance) compared to the 4 week baseline
period before randomization. Drop seizures were defined as atonic, tonic or
tonic-clonic seizures involving the entire body, trunk or head that led or
could have led to a fall, injury, slumping in a chair or hitting the
patient's head on a surface.
  During the treatment period, patients taking Epidiolex 20mg/kg/day achieved
a median reduction in monthly drop seizures of 42 percent compared with a
reduction of 17 percent in patients taking placebo (p=0.0047), and patients
taking Epidiolex 10mg/kg/day achieved a median reduction in monthly drop
seizures of 37 percent compared with a reduction of 17 percent in patients
taking placebo (p=0.0016).
  A series of sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint for both dose
groups confirmed the robustness of these results. In both dose groups, the
difference between Epidiolex and placebo emerged during the first month of
treatment and was sustained during the entire treatment period. Results from
secondary efficacy endpoints in both dose groups reinforced the overall
effectiveness observed with Epidiolex.
  Epidiolex was generally well tolerated in this trial.  The pattern of
adverse events was consistent with that reported in the previous two Phase 3
studies. One patient on 10mg/kg Epidiolex discontinued treatment due to an
adverse event compared with six patients on 20mg/kg and one patient on
placebo.
  Of the 84 percent of 10mg/kg patients who experienced an adverse event, 89
percent of them deemed it to be mild or moderate.  Of the 94 percent of
20mg/kg patients who experienced an adverse event, 88 percent of them
reported it to be mild or moderate. 72 percent of patients on placebo
experienced an adverse event.
  The most common adverse events (occurring in greater than 10 percent of
Epidiolex-treated patients) in the 10mg/kg group were: somnolence, decreased
appetite, upper respiratory infection, diarrhea, and status epilepticus.
None of the cases of status epilepticus in the 10mg/kg group was deemed
treatment-related. The most common adverse events (occurring in greater than
10 percent of Epidiolex-treated patients) in the 20mg/kg group were:
somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, upper respiratory infection,
pyrexia, vomiting, and nasopharyngitis.
  Thirteen patients on Epidiolex 10mg/kg experienced a serious adverse event
(two of which were deemed treatment-related) compared with thirteen patients
on 20mg/kg (five of which were deemed treatment-related) and eight patients
on placebo (none of which were deemed treatment-related).
  There were no deaths in this trial.
  Of the patients who completed this trial, 99 percent have opted to continue
into an open-label extension trial.
  Further data will be presented in future publications and medical meetings.
  Epidiolex New Drug Application (NDA)
  Following the success of the first Dravet syndrome Phase 3 trial earlier
this year, GW requested a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA to discuss a proposed
Dravet syndrome NDA. This meeting took place in July 2016 and also included
some discussion of data from the first Phase 3 LGS trial. As a result of
this constructive meeting, GW believes the guidance received enables the
Company's proposed filing strategy to submit a single NDA that includes
Phase 3 data from one Dravet trial and two LGS trials,  and which remains on
track for a submission in the first half of 2017. Subject to satisfactory
review, GW now anticipates a simultaneous decision on both indications and
does not expect to wait for results from the second trial in Dravet syndrome
prior to this submission.
  In order to support GW's NDA, the Company expects to provide the FDA with
data from ten Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, as well as safety data in over
1,800 patients from both the expanded access program and pivotal programs,
including over 450 patients with one year or more of Epidiolex continuous
exposure. This data is in addition to the pivotal efficacy data.
  Epidiolex has Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of LGS,
Dravet syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and Infantile Spasms.

Incyte Corporation (Nasdaq: INCY) today announced that the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) has published an abstract (#1110PD) containing updated data from the Phase 1 portion of the ECHO-202 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of epacadostat, Incyte’s selective IDO1 enzyme inhibitor, in combination with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy. These data will be highlighted in a poster discussion on Monday, 10 October 2016 from 11:00-12:00 CET at the ESMO Annual Congress 2016 in Copenhagen, Denmark.

In patients with treatment-naïve advanced melanoma (n=19), updated data show a disease control rate (DCR) of 74 percent and an overall response rate (ORR) of 58 percent. All responses are confirmed and ongoing (median follow-up 42 weeks); median progression-free survival (PFS) has not been reached.

“We are very pleased that after extended treatment and longer follow-up, these updated Phase 1 data for epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrate robust, durable clinical activity in patients with treatment-naïve advanced melanoma and reinforce the promise of IDO1 inhibition in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy as an important component of immunotherapy,” said Steven Stein, M.D., Incyte’s Chief Medical Officer.

Epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab was well-tolerated. The most common (≥15%) all grade treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were fatigue, rash, arthralgia, pruritus, diarrhea and nausea. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were observed in 18% of patients; the most common were rash (8%) and increased lipase (3%).

The ECHO-202 abstract was made available today on the ESMO Congress website at http://esmo.org/Conferences/ESMO-2016-Congress.

The ECHO-202 poster is expected to be made available to attendees at the ESMO Congress on Friday, 7 October 2016, at which time the ECHO-202 poster will be made available via the Events and Presentations tab of the Investor section of www.incyte.com. Incyte will also host an investor conference call and webcast at 14:00 CET (8:00 a.m. ET) on 7 October 2016 which can be accessed via the Events and Presentations tab of the Investor section of www.incyte.com.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a key immunosuppressive enzyme that modulates the anti-tumor immune response by promoting regulatory T cell generation and blocking effector T cell activation, thereby facilitating tumor growth by allowing cancer cells to avoid immune surveillance. Epacadostat is a first-in-class, highly potent and selective oral inhibitor of the IDO1 enzyme that reverses tumor-associated immune suppression and restores effective anti-tumor immune responses. In single-arm studies, the combination of epacadostat and immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown proof-of-concept in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In these studies, epacadostat combined with the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab or the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab improved response rates compared with studies of the immune checkpoint inhibitors alone.

These data will be highlighted in a poster discussion on Monday, 10 October 2016 from 11:00-12:00 CET at the ESMO Annual Congress 2016 in Copenhagen, Denmark.  In patients with treatment-naïve advanced melanoma (n=19), updated data show a disease control rate (DCR) of 74 percent and an overall response rate (ORR) of 58 percent. All responses are confirmed and ongoing (median follow-up 42 weeks); median progression-free survival (PFS) has not been reached.  “We are very pleased that after extended treatment and longer follow-up, these updated Phase 1 data for epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrate robust, durable clinical activity in patients with treatment-naïve advanced melanoma and reinforce the promise of IDO1 inhibition in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy as an important component of immunotherapy,” said Steven Stein, M.D., Incyte’s Chief Medical Officer.  Epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab was well-tolerated. The most common (≥15%) all grade treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were fatigue, rash, arthralgia, pruritus, diarrhea and nausea. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were observed in 18% of patients; the most common were rash (8%) and increased lipase (3%).  The ECHO-202 abstract was made available today on the ESMO Congress website at http://esmo.org/Conferences/ESMO-2016-Congress.

  VANCOUVER, British Columbia and DOYLESTOWN, Pa., Sept. 29, 2016 (GLOBE
NEWSWIRE) -- Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Nasdaq:ABUS), an
industry-leading hepatitis B virus (HBV) therapeutic solutions company,
today reported interim results from the first two cohorts of the ongoing
ARB-1467 Phase II multi-dose clinical trial in chronically infected HBV
patients.  The first two cohorts enrolled patients with hepatitis B
e-antigen (HBeAg) negative chronic HBV infection. At this time, serum HBsAg
data are available following single doses for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 and
following multiple doses for Cohort 1.
  Single dose ARB-1467 results for Cohorts 1 and 2 demonstrate significant
reductions in serum HBsAg levels. Importantly, multiple dose results from
Cohort 1 show a step-wise, additive reduction in serum HBsAg. These multiple
dose results are the first of their kind for an RNAi product candidate in
patients with chronic HBV infection. Treatment with ARB-1467 has been
generally well tolerated to date.

  ""The interim ARB-1467 data demonstrate significant serum HBsAg reduction
following the first dose, which is enhanced with repeat dosing. This is a
very important finding because it suggests that even greater reductions in
serum HBsAg levels may be observed with continued dosing of ARB-1467,"" said
Dr. Douglas T. Dieterich, Professor of Medicine in the Division of Liver
Disease at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center. ""These
exciting data demonstrate the antiviral effect of ARB-1467 and the potential
to include this agent as a component of a combination therapy regimen for
the treatment of chronic HBV infection.""
  ""We are excited about these HBV efficacy data from our ongoing ARB-1467
Phase II trial demonstrating substantial reductions in serum HBsAg, which is
an important first step towards one day curing chronic HBV infection. We
believe that further study of ARB-1467 will help determine the optimal
protocol to produce maximal reductions in serum HBsAg,"" said Dr. Mark J.
Murray, Arbutus' President and CEO. ""We plan to release additional
multi-dose data later this year. We believe that ultimately curing HBV will
require combination therapy and we are developing a portfolio of HBV assets
with complementary mechanisms of action to accomplish this goal.""
  ARB-1467 Phase 2 Trial Design
  The Phase II trial is a multi-dose study in chronic HBV patients who are
also receiving stable nucleot(s)ide analog therapy. The trial consists of
three cohorts, each enrolling eight subjects; six receiving three monthly
doses of ARB-1467, and two receiving placebo. The first two cohorts include
HBeAg- patients, followed by a third cohort in HBeAg+ patients.
  About ARB-1467
  Arbutus' RNAi candidate ARB-1467 comprises three RNAi triggers that target
all four HBV transcripts, and has been shown in preclinical studies to
reduce all viral antigen levels as well as cccDNA and HBV DNA.  ARB-1467
utilizes Arbutus' proprietary lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform, a
clinically validated delivery technology which has been tested in hundreds
of patients.

  CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Genocea Biosciences,
Inc. (NASDAQ:GNCA), a biopharmaceutical company developing T cell-directed
vaccines and immunotherapies, today announced positive results from its
ongoing Phase 2b trial evaluating a new Phase 3-ready formulation of GEN-003
for the treatment of genital herpes. The study achieved its primary
endpoint, with GEN-003 demonstrating a statistically significant reduction
of 40 percent in the rate of viral shedding in the 60 ug per protein / 50 ug
of Matrix-M2 dose group compared to both baseline and placebo. The viral
shedding rate reduction for this dose was consistent with its performance at
the same time point in a prior Phase 2 trial.
  ""We are very encouraged by this positive data and have now selected a dose
of 60 ug per protein / 50 ug of Matrix-M2 of GEN-003 for our planned Phase 3
trials. This is the third consecutive trial in which GEN-003 has
demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in viral activity
immediately post-dosing. In the previous Phase 2 trial, success in this
measure translated into a significant impact on genital herpes clinical
disease, durable to at least 12 months,"" said Chip Clark, president and
chief executive officer of Genocea. ""This body of data supports our strong
belief that GEN-003 could be a cornerstone treatment for genital herpes. We
look forward to reporting six-month placebo-controlled clinical data from
this trial in January 2017 and expect to commence our Phase 3 program in the
second half of 2017.""
  During the 28-day observation period immediately after completion of dosing,

  ""The established clinical profile of GEN-003 is one that could be highly
beneficial to patients looking for an effective treatment which potentially
offers greatly improved convenience over daily oral antivirals, the only
current treatment option for the millions of people suffering from genital
herpes,"" said Lori A. Panther, M.D., MPH, Infectious Diseases specialist at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Assistant Professor of Medicine at
Harvard Medical School.  ""I'm extremely encouraged by these results, once
again demonstrating that GEN-003 reduces viral shedding. Control of viral
shedding is fundamental to the control of genital herpes outbreaks and the
epidemic spread of the disease.""
  About the GEN-003 Phase 2b Clinical Trial
  This Phase 2b trial is the first study testing potential Phase 3 endpoints
with an improved formulation of GEN-003 - manufactured with
commercially-scalable processes - which will be used in future Phase 3
trials. The trial enrolled 131 subjects from 9 institutions in the United
States. Subjects have been randomized to one of three dose groups - placebo,
60 ug per protein / 50 ug of Matrix-M2 and 60 ug per protein / 75 ug of
Matrix M2 - and have received three injections at 21-day intervals. Viral
shedding rate reductions were measured to demonstrate the efficacy of the
new formulation. The study will also compare GEN-003 efficacy to placebo for
the clinical endpoints of: the proportion of patients who are lesion free at
six and 12 months after dosing; the time to first lesion recurrence after
dosing; and, the impact on percentage of days with genital herpes lesions at
six and 12 months after dosing. All subjects will be followed for 12 months
after the last dose.

  About GEN-003
  Inducing a T cell response against genital herpes is critical to treating
the clinical symptoms of disease and controlling transmission of the
infection. GEN-003 is a first-in-class T cell directed immunotherapy
designed to elicit both a T cell and B cell (antibody) immune response. The
immunotherapy was designed using Genocea's ATLAS(TM) platform, which
profiles the comprehensive spectrum of actual T cell responses mounted by
humans in response to disease, to identify antigen targets that drive T cell
response. GEN-003 includes the antigens ICP4 and gD2 along with
Matrix-M2(TM)  adjuvant, which Genocea licenses from Novavax, Inc. For more

  About Genital Herpes
  Genital Herpes affects more than 400 million people worldwide and causes
recurrent, painful genital lesions. It can be transmitted to sexual
partners, even when the disease is asymptomatic. Current genital herpes
therapies only partially control clinical symptoms and viral shedding, a
process which drives disease transmission. Incomplete control of genital
lesions and transmission risk, expense and the perceived inconvenience of
taking a daily medication are hurdles for long-term disease management.
Immunity through T cells is believed to be particularly critical to the
control and possible prevention of genital herpes infections.
  About Genocea
  Genocea is harnessing the power of T cell immunity to develop life-changing
vaccines and immunotherapies. T cells are increasingly recognized as a
critical element of protective immune responses to a wide range of diseases,
but traditional discovery methods have proven unable to identify the targets
of such protective immune response. Using ATLAS, its proprietary technology
platform, Genocea identifies these targets to potentially enable the rapid
development of medicines to address critical patient needs. Genocea's
pipeline of novel clinical stage T cell-enabled product candidates includes
GEN-003 for genital herpes, GEN-004 for the prevention of infection by all
serotypes of pneumococcus (development suspended pending further data
analysis and consultation with our advisers), and earlier-stage programs in
cancer immunotherapy, chlamydia, genital herpes prophylaxis and malaria .

(NASDAQ:GNCA), a biopharmaceutical company developing T cell-directed vaccines and immunotherapies, today announced positive results from its ongoing Phase 2b trial evaluating a new Phase 3-ready formulation of GEN-003 for the treatment of genital herpes. The study achieved its primary endpoint, with GEN-003 demonstrating a statistically significant reduction of 40 percent in the rate of viral shedding in the 60 ug per protein / 50 ug of Matrix-M2 dose group compared to both baseline and placebo. The viral shedding rate reduction for this dose was consistent with its performance at the same time point in a prior Phase 2 trial.   ""We are very encouraged by this positive data and have now selected a dose of 60 ug per protein / 50 ug of Matrix-M2 of GEN-003 for our planned Phase 3 trials. This is the third consecutive trial in which GEN-003 has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in viral activity immediately post-dosing. In the previous Phase 2 trial, success in this measure translated into a significant impact on genital herpes clinical disease, durable to at least 12 months,"" said Chip Clark, president and chief executive officer of Genocea. ""This body of data supports our strong belief that GEN-003 could be a cornerstone treatment for genital herpes. We look forward to reporting six-month placebo-controlled clinical data from this trial in January 2017 and expect to commence our Phase 3 program in the second half of 2017.""   During the 28-day observation period immediately after completion of dosing, the 60 ug per protein / 50 ug of Matrix-M2 dose of GEN-003 demonstrated a statistically significant 40 percent reduction from baseline in the viral shedding rate versus a marginal increase of 6 percent for placebo.

  PR Newswire
  TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Sept. 30, 2016
  TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Sept. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced topline results from the Phase 2 CAPELLA
study evaluating aflibercept co-formulated with rinucumab, an
anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (anti-PDGFR-beta)
antibody, in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet
AMD). The combination therapy did not demonstrate an improvement in best
corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared to intravitreal aflibercept
injection monotherapy at 12 weeks, the primary endpoint of the study. At 12
weeks, patients in both combination aflibercept/rinucumab groups showed a
5.8 letter improvement in BCVA. Patients treated with aflibercept alone
showed a 7.5 letter improvement in BCVA.
  ""EYLEA(R) (aflibercept) injection is an established, effective therapy that
has set a high bar in the treatment of wet AMD,"" said George D. Yancopoulos
M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron and President of
Regeneron Laboratories. ""The addition of rinucumab did not improve on the
efficacy of aflibercept alone. We are committed to continuing to innovate
for patients with serious vision-threatening diseases, and look forward to
the results of our ongoing combination studies of aflibercept and
nesvacumab, an anti-angiopoietin 2 antibody, for which the preclinical data
is more supportive.""
  EYLEA results in this study were consistent with the efficacy and safety
seen in Phase 3 pivotal studies in wet AMD. The efficacy results in the
CAPELLA trial were consistent across all choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
subtypes. Adding rinucumab to aflibercept showed no benefit on anatomic
endpoints including reduction in retinal thickness or in resolution of
subretinal hyper-reflective material. Ocular adverse events at 12 weeks were
more common in the combination treatment groups (23.5 and 20 percent)
compared to aflibercept alone (16 percent), primarily driven by an increase
in conjunctival hemorrhage, eye irritation and eye pain.
  The ongoing Phase 2, double-masked, randomized, controlled, multiple-dose,
regimen-ranging study has enrolled approximately 500 patients with wet AMD.
Efficacy was evaluated using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale
(ETDRS) BCVA. Patients were randomized into one of three groups and received
fixed doses every four weeks of either aflibercept monotherapy 2mg,
aflibercept 2mg/rinucumab 1mg or aflibercept 2mg/rinucumab 3mg. The
co-formulation was administered as a single intravitreal injection. At week
12, two of the three treatment groups were re-randomized, resulting in five
total dosing groups in the second phase of the study. Data will be evaluated
at 28 weeks and again at 52 weeks, when the study is completed.
  More detailed results will be submitted for presentation at a future medical
congress.

in Development --
  -- Company to Host Conference Call Today at 5:00 p.m. ET --
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 05, 2016--
  Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics
company, announced today that upon the recommendation of the ENDEAVOUR Phase
3 study Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to suspend dosing, the Company has
decided to discontinue development of revusiran, an investigational RNA
interference (RNAi) therapeutic that was being developed for the treatment
of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM). This decision
was made yesterday evening and has been communicated to investigators, study
sites, and regulatory authorities.
  Following recent reports in the Phase 2 OLE study of new onset or worsening
peripheral neuropathy, the ENDEAVOUR DMC assembled yesterday at the
Company's request to review these reports and ENDEAVOUR data on an unblinded
basis. The DMC did not find conclusive evidence for a drug-related
neuropathy signal in the ENDEAVOUR trial, but informed the Company that the
benefit-risk profile for revusiran no longer supported continued dosing. The
Company subsequently reviewed unblinded ENDEAVOUR data which revealed an
imbalance of mortality in the revusiran arm as compared to placebo.
  ""Patient safety comes first. We have stopped all dosing and are actively
monitoring patients across revusiran studies to ensure their safety. We will
also continue to evaluate ENDEAVOUR data to understand the potential cause
of these findings,"" said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at
Alnylam. ""While this outcome is disappointing given the lack of available
treatment options for patients suffering from this devastating disease, we
remain committed to serving the needs of the ATTR amyloidosis community. We
would like to thank patients, caregivers, investigators, and study staff who
have been so supportive of the revusiran program.""
  The decision to discontinue development of revusiran does not affect
patisiran, which is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN), or any other Alnylam
investigational RNAi therapeutic program in development.
  Based on a current assessment of the safety data across the Company's other
programs, which include the ALN-PCSsc program partnered with The Medicines
Company, there is no evidence of a drug-related neuropathy signal in over
800 treated subjects and patients with exposure of up to 34 months. This
includes patisiran, which utilizes a lipid nanoparticle delivery
formulation, and the seven other clinical programs in Alnylam's pipeline,
which all use Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC) GalNAc delivery
technology. ESC-GalNAc conjugates enable dose and exposure levels that are
12-30 times lower than revusiran, which uses Standard Template Chemistry
(STC) GalNAc delivery technology. The Company reaffirms its ""Alnylam 2020""
guidance and remains committed to the advancement of these investigational
RNAi therapeutics for treatment of diseases with high unmet medical need.
  If there are any questions regarding this announcement, please call the
Clinical Trial Information Line at 866-330-0326 (toll-free within the U.S.)
or 617-575-7400 (International). Alternatively, you may email any questions

  About ATTR Amyloidosis
  ATTR amyloidosis is a progressively debilitating and often fatal disease
caused by deposition of transthyretin (TTR) in peripheral tissues. TTR
protein is produced primarily in the liver and is normally a carrier of
vitamin A. In hereditary ATTR amyloidosis (hATTR), mutations in TTR cause
abnormal amyloid proteins to accumulate and damage body organs and tissue,
such as the peripheral nerves and heart, resulting in intractable peripheral
sensory neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or cardiomyopathy. Hereditary
ATTR amyloidosis represents a major unmet medical need with significant
morbidity and mortality; hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN) --
also known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) -- affects
approximately 10,000 people worldwide and hATTR amyloidosis with
cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) -- also known as familial amyloidotic
cardiomyopathy (FAC) -- is estimated to affect at least 40,000 people
worldwide. hATTR-PN patients have a life expectancy of 5 to 15 years from
symptom onset, and the only approved treatment options for early stage
disease are liver transplantation and tafamidis (approved in Europe, certain
countries in Latin America and Japan, where it is approved for all stages of
disease). hATTR-CM is fatal within 2.5 to 5 years of diagnosis and treatment
is currently limited to supportive care. Wild-type ATTR amyloidosis (wtATTR)
-- previously called senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) -- is a
non-hereditary form of TTR cardiac amyloidosis caused by idiopathic
deposition of wild-type TTR; its prevalence is generally unknown, but is
associated with advanced age. There is a significant need for novel
therapeutics to treat patients with ATTR amyloidosis.
  Sanofi Genzyme Alliance
  In January 2014, Alnylam and Sanofi Genzyme, the specialty care global
business unit of Sanofi, formed an alliance to accelerate and expand the
development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics across the world. The
alliance is structured as a multi-product geographic alliance in the field
of rare diseases. Alnylam retains product rights in North America and
Western Europe, while Sanofi Genzyme obtained the right to access certain
programs in Alnylam's current and future Genetic Medicines pipeline in the
rest of the world (ROW) through the end of 2019, together with certain
broader co-development/co-commercialization rights and global rights for
certain products. In the case of patisiran, Alnylam will advance the product
in North America and Western Europe, while Sanofi Genzyme will advance the
product in the ROW.
  About GalNAc Conjugates and Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc
Conjugates
  GalNAc-siRNA conjugates are a proprietary Alnylam delivery platform and are
designed to achieve targeted delivery of RNAi therapeutics to hepatocytes
through uptake by the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Alnylam's Enhanced
Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc-conjugate technology enables
subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability, and a wide
therapeutic index. This delivery platform is being employed in nearly all of
Alnylam's pipeline programs, including programs in clinical development.
  About RNAi
  RNAi (RNA interference) is a revolution in biology, representing a
breakthrough in understanding how genes are turned on and off in cells, and
a completely new approach to drug discovery and development. Its discovery
has been heralded as ""a major scientific breakthrough that happens once
every decade or so,"" and represents one of the most promising and rapidly
advancing frontiers in biology and drug discovery today which was awarded
the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. RNAi is a natural process
of gene silencing that occurs in organisms ranging from plants to mammals.
By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells,
the creation of a major new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics,
is on the horizon. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate
RNAi and comprise Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, target the cause of
diseases by potently silencing specific mRNAs, thereby preventing
disease-causing proteins from being made. RNAi therapeutics have the
potential to treat disease and help patients in a fundamentally new way.
  About LNP Technology
  Alnylam has licenses to Arbutus Biopharma LNP intellectual property for use
in RNAi therapeutic products using LNP technology.
  About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals
  Alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based
on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the translation of RNAi
as a new class of innovative medicines. Alnylam's pipeline of
investigational RNAi therapeutics is focused in 3 Strategic Therapeutic
Areas (STArs): Genetic Medicines, with a broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutics
for the treatment of rare diseases; Cardio-Metabolic Disease, with a
pipeline of RNAi therapeutics toward genetically validated, liver-expressed
disease targets for unmet needs in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases;
and Hepatic Infectious Disease, with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics that
address the major global health challenges of hepatic infectious diseases.
In early 2015, Alnylam launched its ""Alnylam 2020"" guidance for the
advancement and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class
of innovative medicines. Specifically, by the end of 2020, Alnylam expects
to achieve a company profile with 3 marketed products, 10 RNAi therapeutic
clinical programs -- including 4 in late stages of development -- across its
3 STArs. The company's demonstrated commitment to RNAi therapeutics has
enabled it to form major alliances with leading companies including Ionis,
Novartis, Roche, Takeda, Merck, Monsanto, The Medicines Company, and Sanofi
Genzyme. In addition, Alnylam holds an equity position in Regulus
Therapeutics Inc., a company focused on discovery, development, and
commercialization of microRNA therapeutics. Alnylam scientists and

in Patients with Candida spp. Infections and Closing of a $15 Million Term
Loan
  Study Results Confirm Overall Antifungal Activity of Oral SCY-078 in
Patients with Candida Infections
  Well-Tolerated and Active Oral Dose of SCY-078 Identified for Invasive
Candidiasis Patients
  Evidence of Efficacy and Lower Relapse Rates versus Standard of Care in VVC
Patients
  Strong Cash Position to Accelerate and Expand Development of SCY-078 in
Multiple Indications
  JERSEY CITY, N.J., Oct. 05, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Drug development
company SCYNEXIS, Inc. (Nasdaq:SCYX) today announced the complete results of
its two recently completed Phase 2 studies as well as the closing of a $15
million term loan with Solar Capital Ltd. (Nasdaq:SLRC).
  In the first study, treatment with oral SCY-078 in patients with
vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), resulted in significantly better clinical
cure rates and fewer recurrences of VVC at the four-month follow-up when
compared to the standard of care (oral fluconazole). In the second study,
which evaluated oral SCY-078 as a step down therapy in patients with
invasive candidiasis, oral SCY-078 achieved the target exposure for efficacy
and was well-tolerated.
  ""We are delighted with these positive results that support the concept that
a fungicidal product with high tissue penetration like SCY-078 could yield
superior clinical outcomes,"" said David Angulo, M.D., Chief Medical Officer
of SCYNEXIS.  ""We identified a well-tolerated oral dose that achieves our
target exposure in invasive candidiasis patients, and further confirmed the
antifungal activity of oral SCY-078 in two independent human models of
Candida infections.  These results support our planned development of
SCY-078 as the first drug in a novel antifungal class for the treatment of a
broad range of fungal infections with growing unmet medical needs.""
  Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept Study of Oral SCY-078 in Patients with VVC
  The first study evaluated the effect of two dose regimens of SCY-078 in
patients with moderate to severe VVC as a proof-of-concept study to support
the development of SCY-078 in invasive candidiasis and other Candida
infections. Clinical cure rate, defined as a resolution of signs and
symptoms of infection without further antifungal treatment, is now the
recommended primary endpoint per the latest FDA guidelines for VVC. As
previously reported, clinical cure rate was higher for patients receiving
oral SCY-078 compared to oral fluconazole at the test of cure visit (Day
24).  Additionally, follow-up data now available showed a high clinical cure
rate at the four-month visit (end of observation period) of 88% in patients
who received SCY-078 compared to 65% in patients who received fluconazole
(p=0.04). Moreover, during the four-month observation period, patients who
received SCY-078 had a lower recurrence rate (4%) versus fluconazole (15%).
  Phase 2 Study of Oral SCY-078 in Patients with Invasive Candidiasis
  The second study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and
tolerability of SCY-078 as an oral step-down treatment in patients initially
treated with intravenous (IV) echinocandin therapy for invasive Candida
infections.  Twenty-two patients were randomized to receive study drug or
standard of care (one of the patients randomized to standard of care could
not receive oral fluconazole due to a Candida glabrata with decreased
fluconazole-susceptibility and received micafungin for the entire duration
of antifungal therapy). As previously reported, the study met its primary
objective by confirming the once daily oral dose of SCY-078 750mg as a dose
that is both overall safe and tolerated and achieves the target exposure in
these patients. During the study period, there were no reports of
mycological failures in the SCY-078 750mg group (n=7) versus two
infection-related failures (one fungemia and one abdominal sepsis) in the
fluconazole group (n=7).  No relapses were observed in these two groups
during the six-week follow-up period.
  As previously reported, SCY-078 was overall safe and tolerated in both
studies. There were no discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) and no
related serious AEs. Consistent with previous findings, the most common AEs
were mild to moderate gastrointestinal (GI) events such as diarrhea nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain or discomfort. In patients with invasive
candidiasis, the number of GI events were comparable in both the SCY-078 and
fluconazole treatment arms.
  ""We achieved our stated goals and further de-risked the development of our
lead product candidate, SCY-078,"" said Marco Taglietti, M.D., President and
Chief Executive Officer of SCYNEXIS. ""With these positive Phase 2 data in
hand, we believe SCY-078 is now the most advanced novel agent in a new
antifungal class that can address the growing issue of resistance. We are
also pleased to announce the infusion of additional funds from Solar
Capital, providing us with the financial strength and flexibility to
accelerate and expand the development of SCY-078 and to leverage our
internal antifungal platform.""
  Additional Capital Raised
  SCYNEXIS closed a $15 million term loan with Solar Capital, fully funded at
close.  This transaction complements the company's recent equity raise, and
results in minimal dilution to shareholders.  Please refer to the Form 8-K
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional
information about the facility.
  ""Solar Capital is pleased to start a financing partnership with SCYNEXIS
that should enable the company to expand its pipeline of indications for
SCY-078, as well as accelerate its other development programs,"" said Anthony
Storino, head of life science lending at Solar Capital. ""We believe SCYNEXIS
offers a unique value proposition in an area with significant unmet medical
needs, and we are excited to contribute to the company's growth and future
successes.""
  As of September 30, 2016, SCYNEXIS' preliminary estimate of its cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities totaled $58.4 million, including the
$15 million from the loan facility.
  Armentum Partners acted as financial advisor to SCYNEXIS on the loan
facility.

oral fluconazole in adult female patients with acute vulvovaginal
candidiasis (VVC). A total of 96 patients with an acute moderate to severe,
symptomatic episode of VVC were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive
either three daily doses or five daily doses of oral SCY-078 750mg QD with a
1,250mg loading dose or oral fluconazole, at the labeled approved dose
regimen of 150mg single dose. This was a pilot investigation and not powered
to demonstrate a statistical significant difference in the parameters tested
(p values for the comparisons mentioned were >0.05 unless otherwise
indicated). Efficacy was evaluated based on the proportion of patients
achieving clinical cure, mycological eradication and therapeutic cure
(combination of both clinical cure and mycological eradication) at day 24
(+/-3) after initiation of treatment. The 3-day and the 5-day SCY-078
regimens performed similarly, allowing a pooled analysis.  Intent-to-treat
(ITT) population is defined as all subjects randomized (n=96 subjects).
Per-Protocol (PP) population is defined as subjects with culture confirmed
Candida infection at baseline (n=70 subjects).  Subjects in the PP
population were followed for four months. Recurrence was defined as a
symptomatic VVC episode requiring additional antifungal therapy, per
investigators' decision.
  Phase 2 Study of Oral SCY-078 in Patients with Invasive Candidiasis
  Multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label study (clinicaltrials.gov
identifier: NCT02244606) following three to ten days of IV echinocandin
therapy. A total of 27 patients with invasive candidiasis were enrolled and
22 were randomized to receive either SCY-078 500mg QD with a 1,000mg loading
dose (7 patients), SCY-078 750mg QD with a 1,250mg loading dose (7 patients)
or standard of care (7 patients receiving fluconazole 400mg QD with a 800mg
loading dose and 1 patient receiving micafungin IV 100mg QD due to a Candida
glabrata with decreased fluconazole-susceptibility for up to 28 days).
Efficacy was assessed based on achievement of favorable global response
defined as the resolution of signs and symptoms attributable to the Candida
infection and mycological eradication without the use of any other
antifungal agent.  Patients were followed for six weeks after the end of
treatment.
  About SCY-078
  SCY-078 is an oral and IV glucan synthase inhibitor in Phase 2 clinical
development for the treatment for fungal infections caused by Candida and
Aspergillus species. SCY-078 is a semi-synthetic triterpene derivative of
the natural product enfumafungin--a structurally distinct class of glucan
synthase inhibitor. SCY-078 combines the well-established activity of glucan
synthase inhibitors (similar to echinocandins) with the flexibility of
having intravenous (IV) and oral formulations (similar to azoles). By
belonging to a chemical class distinct from other antifungals, SCY-078 has
shown in vitro and in vivo activity against multi-drug resistant pathogens,
including azole and echinocandin resistant strains. Positive results from
two recently reported Phase 2 studies provided evidence of the antifungal
activity of orally administered SCY-078 in patients with Candida infections.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track, Qualified
Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and orphan drug designations (ODD) for the
oral and IV formulations of SCY-078 for the indications of invasive Candida
infections (including candidemia) and invasive Aspergillus infections.
  About Invasive Candidiasis
","SCYNEXIS Announces Complete Results from Two Phase 2 Studies of Oral SCY-078 in Patients with Candida spp. Infections and Closing of a $15 Million Term Loan   Study Results Confirm Overall Antifungal Activity of Oral SCY-078 in Patients with Candida Infections   Well-Tolerated and Active Oral Dose of SCY-078 Identified for Invasive Candidiasis Patients   Evidence of Efficacy and Lower Relapse Rates versus Standard of Care in VVC Patients   Strong Cash Position to Accelerate and Expand Development of SCY-078 in Multiple Indications   JERSEY CITY, N.J., Oct. 05, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Drug development company SCYNEXIS, Inc. (Nasdaq:SCYX) today announced the complete results of its two recently completed Phase 2 studies as well as the closing of a $15 million term loan with Solar Capital Ltd. (Nasdaq:SLRC).   In the first study, treatment with oral SCY-078 in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), resulted in significantly better clinical cure rates and fewer recurrences of VVC at the four-month follow-up when compared to the standard of care (oral fluconazole). In the second study, which evaluated oral SCY-078 as a step down therapy in patients with invasive candidiasis, oral SCY-078 achieved the target exposure for efficacy and was well-tolerated.   ""We are delighted with these positive results that support the concept that a fungicidal product with high tissue penetration like SCY-078 could yield superior clinical outcomes,"" said David Angulo, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of SCYNEXIS.  ""We identified a well-tolerated oral dose that achieves our target exposure in invasive candidiasis patients, and further confirmed the antifungal activity of oral SCY-078 in two independent human models of Candida infections.  These results support our planned development of SCY-078 as the first drug in a novel antifungal class for the treatment of a broad range of fungal infections with growing unmet medical needs.""   Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept Study of Oral SCY-078 in Patients with VVC   The first study evaluated the effect of two dose regimens of SCY-078 in patients with moderate to severe VVC as a proof-of-concept study to support the development of SCY-078 in invasive candidiasis and other Candida infections. Clinical cure rate, defined as a resolution of signs and symptoms of infection without further antifungal treatment, is now the recommended primary endpoint per the latest FDA guidelines for VVC. As previously reported, clinical cure rate was higher for patients receiving oral SCY-078 compared to oral fluconazole at the test of cure visit (Day 24).  Additionally, follow-up data now available showed a high clinical cure rate at the four-month visit (end of observation period) of 88% in patients who received SCY-078 compared to 65% in patients who received fluconazole (p=0.04). Moreover, during the four-month observation period, patients who received SCY-078 had a lower recurrence rate (4%) versus fluconazole (15%).   Phase 2 Study of Oral SCY-078 in Patients with Invasive Candidiasis   The second study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of SCY-078 as an oral step-down treatment in patients initially treated with intravenous (IV) echinocandin therapy for invasive Candida infections.  Twenty-two patients were randomized to receive study drug or standard of care (one of the patients randomized to standard of care could not receive oral fluconazole due to a Candida glabrata with decreased fluconazole-susceptibility and received micafungin for the entire duration of antifungal therapy). As previously reported, the study met its primary objective by confirming the once daily oral dose of SCY-078 750mg as a dose that is both overall safe and tolerated and achieves the target exposure in these patients. During the study period, there were no reports of mycological failures in the SCY-078 750mg group (n=7) versus two infection-related failures (one fungemia and one abdominal sepsis) in the fluconazole group (n=7).  No relapses were observed in these two groups during the six-week follow-up period.   As previously reported, SCY-078 was overall safe and tolerated in both studies. There were no discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) and no related serious AEs. Consistent with previous findings, the most common AEs were mild to moderate gastrointestinal (GI) events such as diarrhea nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or discomfort. In patients with invasive candidiasis, the number of GI events were comparable in both the SCY-078 and fluconazole treatment arms.   ""We achieved our stated goals and further de-risked the development of our lead product candidate, SCY-078,"" said Marco Taglietti, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of SCYNEXIS. ""With these positive Phase 2 data in hand, we believe SCY-078 is now the most advanced novel agent in a new antifungal class that can address the growing issue of resistance. We are also pleased to announce the infusion of additional funds from Solar Capital, providing us with the financial strength and flexibility to accelerate and expand the development of SCY-078 and to leverage our internal antifungal platform.""   Additional Capital Raised   SCYNEXIS closed a $15 million term loan with Solar Capital, fully funded at close.  This transaction complements the company's recent equity raise, and results in minimal dilution to shareholders.  Please refer to the Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional information about the facility.   ""Solar Capital is pleased to start a financing partnership with SCYNEXIS that should enable the company to expand its pipeline of indications for SCY-078, as well as accelerate its other development programs,"" said Anthony Storino, head of life science lending at Solar Capital. ""We believe SCYNEXIS offers a unique value proposition in an area with significant unmet medical needs, and we are excited to contribute to the company's growth and future successes.""   As of September 30, 2016, SCYNEXIS' preliminary estimate of its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $58.4 million, including the $15 million from the loan facility.   Armentum Partners acted as financial advisor to SCYNEXIS on the loan facility.

Rucaparib NDA Dataset to be presented in oral presentation today at ESMO
Rucaparib NDA currently under priority review with FDA
Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date is February 23, 2017
European Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) submission planned for Q4 2016
Clovis Oncology (NASDAQ:CLVS) announced today the oral presentation of the primary efficacy and safety data from its NDA dataset for rucaparib at the 2016 ESMO Congress in Copenhagen. Rucaparib is currently under priority review with FDA for the monotherapy treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients with BRCA-mutated tumors inclusive of both germline and somatic BRCA mutations who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and the submission has a PDUFA date of February 23, 2017.

Rucaparib is the Company’s oral, small molecule inhibitor of PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3 currently being developed for the treatment of ovarian cancer, specifically in patients with tumors with BRCA mutations and other DNA repair deficiencies beyond BRCA, including those with high genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) also known as “BRCA-like."" The current NDA submission seeks approval in patients with tumor BRCA mutations, which includes both germline and somatic mutations.

“These results demonstrate that rucaparib may represent an important option for women with multiply relapsed BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer based on its encouraging efficacy and tolerability,” said Rebecca S. Kristeleit, MD, PhD, The University College London, Cancer Institute, London, UK. “In my opinion, rucaparib has the hallmarks of an important new therapeutic option for ovarian cancer patients.”

“We are pleased to present the primary efficacy and safety dataset that has been submitted to the FDA as the basis of our NDA for rucaparib in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. If approved, rucaparib would be the first PARP inhibitor in the U.S. indicated to treat ovarian cancer patients with germline or somatic BRCA mutations who have received two prior chemotherapies. Women with BRCA mutations represent about 25% of patients in the US living with ovarian cancer,” said Patrick J. Mahaffy, CEO and President of Clovis Oncology. “Our NDA review is ongoing with FDA, and in addition we are actively preparing for a European submission during the fourth quarter of 2016.”

Data from subgroups of two multicenter, single-arm open-label phase 2 studies, Study 10 (NCT01482715) and ARIEL2 (NCT01891344) were combined for an integrated efficacy and safety analysis which further characterized the clinical benefit of rucaparib at the recommended starting dose of 600 mg BID in women with advanced ovarian cancer. In the two studies, 377 patients met the criteria for inclusion in the safety population (diagnosis of ovarian cancer and having received one or more doses of the recommended dose of 600 mg of rucaparib), and 106 patients met the criteria for inclusion in the efficacy population (received 2 or more prior chemotherapies, including 2 or more platinum-based regimens, had a mutation of BRCA (germline or somatic), and received one or more doses of the recommended dose of 600 mg of rucaparib.

The major efficacy outcome measure for this analysis was objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST. All responses were confirmed.

For the efficacy population (n=106), the median number of prior chemotherapies was three, with 39% having received two prior therapies and 61% of patients having received three or more prior therapies. The median number of prior platinum-based therapies was two, with 57% having received two prior platinum-based therapies, and 43% having received three or more prior platinum-based therapies. Seventy-five percent of patients in the efficacy population were platinum-sensitive (as defined by recurrence after progression free interval (PFI) of ≥6 months), 19% were platinum resistant (recurrence after PFI <6 months) and 7% were platinum refractory (progression on platinum, PFI <2 months).

Summary of Efficacy Data

The RECIST ORR (objective response rate as assessed by the investigator, which includes complete and partial responses) in the efficacy population was 57/106, or 54% (95% CI: 43.8-63.5). This includes nine (9%) complete responders (CR) and 48 (45%) partial responders (PR). Thirty-six patients (34%) had stable disease (SD) as the best response, while nine patients (9%) had progressive disease (PD) as the best response and four (4%) were not evaluable (NE). Seventy-five of 106 patients, or 71% (95% CI: 61.1-79.2) had a RECIST or CA-125 response.

For the 42 patients from Study 10 included in the efficacy population, the RECIST ORR was 25/42, or 60% (95% CI: 43.3-74.4). This included four CRs (10%) and 21 PRs (50%). In addition, 12 patients (29%) had SD, two patients (5%) had PD and three (7%) were NE. For the 64 patients from ARIEL2 included in the efficacy population, the RECIST ORR was 32/64, or 50% (95% CI: 37.2-62.8). This included five CRs (8%) and 27 PRs (42%). In addition, 24 patients (38%) had SD, seven (11%) had PD and one (2%) was NE. Study 10 was limited to platinum sensitive patients; ARIEL2 included platinum sensitive, platinum resistant and platinum refractory patients.

In addition, ORR was assessed by subgroups including BRCA mutation type, number of prior chemotherapies and prior platinum regimens, PFI and platinum status. Patients with a BRCA1 (n=67) or BRCA2 (n=39) mutation both showed an ORR of 54% (95% CI: 41.1-66.0, 37.2-69.9, respectively) in line with the overall population. The ORR for patients with germline BRCA mutations (n=88) and somatic BRCA mutations (n=13) was 53% (95% CI: 42.5-64.1) and 46% (95% CI: 19.2-74.9), respectively; in addition, five patients with a BRCA mutation but unknown germline or somatic status had an ORR of 80% (95% CI: 28.4-99.5). Patients who received two prior chemotherapies (n=41) achieved an ORR of 68% (95% CI: 51.9-81.9). Patients who received two prior platinum regimens (n=60) demonstrated an ORR of 65% (95% CI: 51.6-76.9). Response by length of PFI differed for patients with PFI<6 months (n=27), 6-12 months (n=56) and greater than 12 months (n=23), reporting 19% (95% CI: 6.3-38.1), 63% (95% CI: 48.6-75.1) and 74% (95% CI: 51.6-89.8), respectively. Response by platinum status was reported as 0% (95% CI: 0.0-41.0) for platinum-refractory patients (n=7), 25% (95% CI: 8.7-49.1) for platinum-resistant patients (n=20), and 66% (95% CI: 54.3-76.1) for platinum-sensitive patients (n=79).

Duration of response by investigator assessment in the efficacy population was 9.2 months (95% CI: 6.6-11.7 months), and the censoring rate among responders was 47%. As of the cutoff dates, 20 patients with a RECIST response had an ongoing response.

Additionally, analyses not contained within the NDA submission showed median progression-free survival by investigator assessment in the efficacy population to be 10.0 months. Of 106 patients, 50 patients did not have an event of disease progression or death at the data cut-off dates. Of these 50 patients, 32 patients were still on treatment, and 18 patients discontinued treatment for reasons other than disease progression or death at the data cut-off dates. Of note, 79% of patients remained progression-free at six months, and 41% remained progression-free at 12 months.

For the efficacy dataset, the cut off dates were November 30, 2015 and February 29, 2016, for Study 10 and ARIEL2, respectively.

Summary of Safety Data

Of the 377 ovarian cancer patients treated with a starting dose of rucaparib 600 mg, 377 (100%) experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) of any grade, and 229 (61%) experienced a treatment-emergent AE grade 3 or higher. A total of 360 patients (96%) experienced a treatment-related AE of any grade, and 177 (47%) experienced a treatment-related AE that was grade 3 or higher. AEs leading to dose interruption occurred in 221 patients (59%). Treatment-related AEs leading to dose reduction occurred in 167 patients (44%), and treatment discontinuation in 30 patients (8%). The primary reasons for dose reduction were anemia/decreased hemoglobin (17%), asthenia/fatigue (14%) and nausea (11%). The primary reasons for treatment discontinuation were asthenia/fatigue (2%), small intestinal obstruction (2%) and nausea (1%). Nine patients (2%) had AEs that led to death; eight were due to disease progression, and one death was due to sepsis, which was assessed by the investigator to be unrelated to treatment.

The most common treatment-emergent AEs (all grades) reported in ≥20 percent of patients included nausea (77%), asthenia/fatigue (77%), vomiting (46%), anemia (44%), increased ALT/AST (41%) and constipation (40%). The most common Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent AEs reported in ≥10 percent of patients were anemia (25%), asthenia/fatigue (11%) and ALT/AST elevations (11%).

The increases in aspartate (AST) and alanine (ALT) aminotransferase levels that were observed were asymptomatic, reversible and were rarely associated with increases in bilirubin. The elevations normalized over time with continued rucaparib treatment.

Mild to moderate creatinine elevations were observed within the first few weeks of treatment for most patients, for whom 79 (21%) experienced an AE, of whom two (0.5%) experienced a grade 3/4 event. These elevations in creatinine likely result from inhibition of the renal transporters MATE1 and MATE2-K, which can lead to an increase in serum creatinine in the absence of renal injury.

Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia was reported in less than one percent of patients.

The cut-off dates for the safety dataset were March 31, 2016 for Study 10 and April 29, 2016 for ARIEL2.

About Rucaparib

Rucaparib is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of PARP-1, PARP-2 and PARP-3 being developed for advanced ovarian cancer.

Specifically, rucaparib is being developed as monotherapy treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients with deleterious BRCA-mutated tumors inclusive of both germline and somatic BRCA mutations (as detected by an FDA-approved test) who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies. Rucaparib was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for this proposed indication by the U.S. FDA in April 2015; and in late June 2016, Clovis completed its New Drug Application (NDA) submission to the FDA. The filing for treatment was accepted and has an action date of February 23, 2017. Rucaparib’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency for the proposed treatment indication is planned for Q4 2016.

Foundation Medicine, Clovis’ companion diagnostic partner, has submitted a Premarket Approval (PMA) application for its FoundationFocus CDxBRCA to the FDA in June 2016. The test is designed to identify tumor BRCA mutations. The timing of the submission is expected to allow for regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic in a similar timeframe.

Additionally, rucaparib is being developed as maintenance therapy in the ARIEL3 trial (NCT01968213) for patients with tumors with BRCA mutations and other DNA repair deficiencies beyond BRCA (commonly referred to as homologous recombination deficiencies, or HRD). Data from ARIEL3 are expected in Q4 2017, which is expected to be followed by the submission of a supplemental NDA for second-line maintenance therapy.

Clovis is also exploring rucaparib in other solid tumor types with BRCA mutations or molecular evidence of the HRD signature, including prostate, breast and gastroesophageal cancers.

Clovis holds worldwide rights for rucaparib.

About Ovarian Cancer

According to the American Cancer Society, more than 22,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the U.S. during 2016. There are often no clearly identifiable initial symptoms, and in an estimated 80 to 85% of ovarian cancer cases, the cancer has spread to other parts of the body before a person is diagnosed and can be treated. Ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths and causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. One in four women with ovarian cancer have a germline or somatic BRCA mutation, and new treatment options are needed to treat unique patient populations.

All responses were confirmed.  For the efficacy population (n=106), the median number of prior chemotherapies was three, with 39% having received two prior therapies and 61% of patients having received three or more prior therapies. The median number of prior platinum-based therapies was two, with 57% having received two prior platinum-based therapies, and 43% having received three or more prior platinum-based therapies. Seventy-five percent of patients in the efficacy population were platinum-sensitive (as defined by recurrence after progression free interval (PFI) of ≥6 months), 19% were platinum resistant (recurrence after PFI <6 months) and 7% were platinum refractory (progression on platinum, PFI <2 months).  Summary of Efficacy Data  The RECIST ORR (objective response rate as assessed by the investigator, which includes complete and partial responses) in the efficacy population was 57/106, or 54% (95% CI: 43.8-63.5). This includes nine (9%) complete responders (CR) and 48 (45%) partial responders (PR). Thirty-six patients (34%) had stable disease (SD) as the best response, while nine patients (9%) had progressive disease (PD) as the best response and four (4%) were not evaluable (NE). Seventy-five of 106 patients, or 71% (95% CI: 61.1-79.2) had a RECIST or CA-125 response.  For the 42 patients from Study 10 included in the efficacy population, the RECIST ORR was 25/42, or 60% (95% CI: 43.3-74.4). This included four CRs (10%) and 21 PRs (50%). In addition, 12 patients (29%) had SD, two patients (5%) had PD and three (7%) were NE. For the 64 patients from ARIEL2 included in the efficacy population, the RECIST ORR was 32/64, or 50% (95% CI: 37.2-62.8). This included five CRs (8%) and 27 PRs (42%). In addition, 24 patients (38%) had SD, seven (11%) had PD and one (2%) was NE. Study 10 was limited to platinum sensitive patients; ARIEL2 included platinum sensitive, platinum resistant and platinum refractory patients.  In addition, ORR was assessed by subgroups including BRCA mutation type, number of prior chemotherapies and prior platinum regimens, PFI and platinum status. Patients with a BRCA1 (n=67) or BRCA2 (n=39) mutation both showed an ORR of 54% (95% CI: 41.1-66.0, 37.2-69.9, respectively) in line with the overall population. The ORR for patients with germline BRCA mutations (n=88) and somatic BRCA mutations (n=13) was 53% (95% CI: 42.5-64.1) and 46% (95% CI: 19.2-74.9), respectively; in addition, five patients with a BRCA mutation but unknown germline or somatic status had an ORR of 80% (95% CI: 28.4-99.5). Patients who received two prior chemotherapies (n=41) achieved an ORR of 68% (95% CI: 51.9-81.9). Patients who received two prior platinum regimens (n=60) demonstrated an ORR of 65% (95% CI: 51.6-76.9). Response by length of PFI differed for patients with PFI<6 months (n=27), 6-12 months (n=56) and greater than 12 months (n=23), reporting 19% (95% CI: 6.3-38.1), 63% (95% CI: 48.6-75.1) and 74% (95% CI: 51.6-89.8), respectively. Response by platinum status was reported as 0% (95% CI: 0.0-41.0) for platinum-refractory patients (n=7), 25% (95% CI: 8.7-49.1) for platinum-resistant patients (n=20), and 66% (95% CI: 54.3-76.1) for platinum-sensitive patients (n=79).  Duration of response by investigator assessment in the efficacy population was 9.2 months (95% CI: 6.6-11.7 months), and the censoring rate among responders was 47%. As of the cutoff dates, 20 patients with a RECIST response had an ongoing response.  Additionally, analyses not contained within the NDA submission showed median progression-free survival by investigator assessment in the efficacy population to be 10.0 months. Of 106 patients, 50 patients did not have an event of disease progression or death at the data cut-off dates. Of these 50 patients, 32 patients were still on treatment, and 18 patients discontinued treatment for reasons other than disease progression or death at the data cut-off dates. Of note, 79% of patients remained progression-free at six months, and 41% remained progression-free at 12 months.  For the efficacy dataset, the cut off dates were November 30, 2015 and February 29, 2016, for Study 10 and ARIEL2, respectively.  Summary of Safety Data  Of the 377 ovarian cancer patients treated with a starting dose of rucaparib 600 mg, 377 (100%) experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) of any grade, and 229 (61%) experienced a treatment-emergent AE grade 3 or higher. A total of 360 patients (96%) experienced a treatment-related AE of any grade, and 177 (47%) experienced a treatment-related AE that was grade 3 or higher. AEs leading to dose interruption occurred in 221 patients (59%). Treatment-related AEs leading to dose reduction occurred in 167 patients (44%), and treatment discontinuation in 30 patients (8%). The primary reasons for dose reduction were anemia/decreased hemoglobin (17%), asthenia/fatigue (14%) and nausea (11%). The primary reasons for treatment discontinuation were asthenia/fatigue (2%), small intestinal obstruction (2%) and nausea (1%). Nine patients (2%) had AEs that led to death; eight were due to disease progression, and one death was due to sepsis, which was assessed by the investigator to be unrelated to treatment.  The most common treatment-emergent AEs (all grades) reported in ≥20 percent of patients included nausea (77%), asthenia/fatigue (77%), vomiting (46%), anemia (44%), increased ALT/AST (41%) and constipation (40%). The most common Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent AEs reported in ≥10 percent of patients were anemia (25%), asthenia/fatigue (11%) and ALT/AST elevations (11%).  The increases in aspartate (AST) and alanine (ALT) aminotransferase levels that were observed were asymptomatic, reversible and were rarely associated with increases in bilirubin. The elevations normalized over time with continued rucaparib treatment.  Mild to moderate creatinine elevations were observed within the first few weeks of treatment for most patients, for whom 79 (21%) experienced an AE, of whom two (0.5%) experienced a grade 3/4 event. These elevations in creatinine likely result from inhibition of the renal transporters MATE1 and MATE2-K, which can lead to an increase in serum creatinine in the absence of renal injury.  Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia was reported in less than one percent of patients.  The cut-off dates for the safety dataset were March 31, 2016 for Study 10 and April 29, 2016 for ARIEL2.  Presentation Details  The oral presentation, titled “Clinical activity of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor rucaparib in patients (pts) with high grade ovarian carcinoma (HGOC) and a BRCA mutation (BRCAmut): Analysis of pooled data from Study 10 (parts 1, 2a, and 3) and ARIEL2 (parts 1 and 2)” was presented today by Rebecca S. Kristeleit, PhD, The University College London, Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom during the Session titled “Gynecological Cancers”, from 2:00pm-3:30pm CEST (Abstract 856O: 2:45pm-3:00pm CEST).  The Trials-in-Progress poster presentation, titled “Window study of the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in patients with primary triple negative or BRCA1/2 related breast cancer (RIO)” is being presented Monday by Christy Toms, PhD, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, United Kingdom during the Poster Session titled “Breast Cancer, Early Stage” from 1:00pm-2:00pm CEST (Abstract 219TiP, Poster Board #219).  The presentations will be available online at http://clovisoncology.com/products-companion-diagnostics/scientific-presentations/ at the time of their scheduled presentation at the Congress.  About Rucaparib  Rucaparib is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of PARP-1, PARP-2 and PARP-3 being developed for advanced ovarian cancer.  Specifically, rucaparib is being developed as monotherapy treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients with deleterious BRCA-mutated tumors inclusive of both germline and somatic BRCA mutations (as detected by an FDA-approved test) who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies. Rucaparib was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for this proposed indication by the U.S. FDA in April 2015; and in late June 2016, Clovis completed its New Drug Application (NDA) submission to the FDA. The filing for treatment was accepted and has an action date of February 23, 2017. Rucaparib’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency for the proposed treatment indication is planned for Q4 2016.  Foundation Medicine, Clovis’ companion diagnostic partner, has submitted a Premarket Approval (PMA) application for its FoundationFocus CDxBRCA to the FDA in June 2016. The test is designed to identify tumor BRCA mutations. The timing of the submission is expected to allow for regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic in a similar timeframe.  Additionally, rucaparib is being developed as maintenance therapy in the ARIEL3 trial (NCT01968213) for patients with tumors with BRCA mutations and other DNA repair deficiencies beyond BRCA (commonly referred to as homologous recombination deficiencies, or HRD). Data from ARIEL3 are expected in Q4 2017, which is expected to be followed by the submission of a supplemental NDA for second-line maintenance therapy.  Clovis is also exploring rucaparib in other solid tumor types with BRCA mutations or molecular evidence of the HRD signature, including prostate, breast and gastroesophageal cancers.  Clovis holds worldwide rights for rucaparib.  About Ovarian Cancer  According to the American Cancer Society, more than 22,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the U.S. during 2016. There are often no clearly identifiable initial symptoms, and in an estimated 80 to 85% of ovarian cancer cases, the cancer has spread to other parts of the body before a person is diagnosed and can be treated. Ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths and causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. One in four women with ovarian cancer have a germline or somatic BRCA mutation, and new treatment options are needed to treat unique patient populations.  About Clovis Oncology  Clovis Oncology, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing innovative anti-cancer agents in the U.S., Europe and additional international markets. Clovis Oncology targets development programs at specific subsets of cancer populations, and simultaneously develops diagnostic tools that direct a compound in development to the population that is most likely to benefit from its use.

  COPENHAGEN, Oct. 08, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TESARO, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSRO), an
oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, and ENGOT, the European Network
for Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups, today announced the
presentation of the niraparib Phase 3 ENGOT-OV16/NOVA clinical trial results
at the ESMO 2016 Congress, the congress of the European Society for Medical
Oncology (ESMO), by Dr. Mansoor Raza Mirza, M.D., Medical Director of the
Nordic Society of Gynecologic Oncology (NSGO) and principal investigator on
the ENGOT-OV16/NOVA trial. These data were discussed during the ESMO press
briefing in Copenhagen as part of the congress, and were simultaneously
published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.(1) The results will
also be presented by Dr. Mirza later today during Presidential Symposium 1
(Abstract #LBA3_PR) at ESMO.

  ENGOT-OV16/NOVA is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, international Phase 3
trial of niraparib that enrolled 553 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer
who were in response to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy. This
trial was designed to assess progression free survival (PFS) in a broad
population of patients who were assigned to one of two cohorts based upon
germline BRCA mutation status. The ENGOT-OV16/NOVA trial successfully
achieved its primary endpoint in both cohorts, demonstrating that niraparib
treatment significantly prolonged PFS compared to control in patients who
were germline BRCA mutation (gBRCAmut) carriers and in patients who were not
germline BRCA mutation (non-gBRCAmut) carriers. In addition, within the
non-gBRCA cohort, niraparib treatment significantly prolonged PFS compared
to control for the prospectively defined patient population with tumors
deficient in homologous recombination (HRDpos) as determined by the Myriad
myChoice(R) HRD test. A high proportion of patients in both treatment groups
in both cohorts had received three or more prior lines of chemotherapy.
  ""These landmark results are extremely encouraging for the ovarian cancer
community,"" said Dr. Mirza. ""The effectiveness of platinum-based
chemotherapy diminishes over time, and PFS and platinum-free intervals
generally become shorter after each round of platinum treatment. In
addition, the incidence of infection and risk of neuropathy and
hypersensitivity with certain chemotherapy agents rises with subsequent
cycles. An oral maintenance treatment that could lengthen the PFS interval
between rounds of platinum-based chemotherapy would be very meaningful for
patients with ovarian cancer, who often live with a fear of recurrence after
ending active treatment.""
  ""We would like to thank the patients, their families and the caregivers that
participated in the ENGOT-OV16/NOVA study, as well as our partners at ENGOT
for their diligence in executing this trial,"" said Mary Lynne Hedley, Ph.D.,
President and COO of TESARO. ""We believe the results of this Phase 3 study
demonstrated a meaningful benefit for women with platinum sensitive,
recurrent ovarian cancer.""
  Primary Endpoint Results:
  Statistically Significant PFS Results in the gBRCAmut Cohort
  Among patients who were germline BRCA mutation carriers, the niraparib arm
successfully achieved statistical significance over the control arm for the
primary endpoint of PFS, with a hazard ratio of 0.27 (95% CI, 0.173-0.410).
The median PFS for patients treated with niraparib was 21.0 months, compared
to 5.5 months for control (p<0.0001).
  Statistically Significant PFS Results in the non-gBRCAmut Cohort
  Niraparib showed statistical significance for patients in the non-germline
BRCA mutant cohort. The niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical
significance over the control arm for the primary endpoint of PFS, with a
hazard ratio of 0.45 (95% CI, 0.338-0.607). The median PFS for patients
treated with niraparib was 9.3 months, compared to 3.9 months for control
(p<0.0001).
  Statistically Significant PFS Results in non-gBRCAmut Cohort for Patients
with HRD-Positive Tumors
  For patients who were not germline BRCA mutation carriers but whose tumors
were determined to be HRD positive using the Myriad myChoice(R) HRD test,
the niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical significance over the
control arm for the primary endpoint of PFS, with a hazard ratio of 0.38
(95% CI, 0.243-0.586). The median PFS for patients with HRD-positive tumors
who were treated with niraparib was 12.9 months, compared to 3.8 months for
control (p<0.0001).
  Secondary Endpoint Results:
  Secondary endpoint analyses, including chemotherapy-free interval, time to
first subsequent treatment, and PFS 2 were all statistically significant and
favored niraparib over control for patients in both the gBRCAmut and
non-gBRCAmut cohorts. Patient-reported outcome results from validated survey
tools indicated that niraparib-treated patients reported no difference from
control in measures associated with quality of life. Data for overall
survival are immature (HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.480 to 1.125; p=0.1545), as fewer
than 20% of events had occurred at the time of analysis.
  Safety Results:
  The most common (>=10%) treatment-emergent grade 3/4 adverse events in the
niraparib arm were thrombocytopenia (33.8%), anemia (25.3%), and neutropenia
(19.6%) with treatment discontinuation for these events of 3.3%, 1.4% and
1.9%, respectively. Thrombocytopenia was not associated with grade 3/4
bleeding events. The majority of these hematological laboratory
abnormalities occurred within the first three cycles; following dose
modifications the incidence of these lab abnormalities decreased and
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were infrequent beyond cycle 3. The rates
of MDS/AML in the niraparib (1.4%) and control (1.1%) arms were similar.
There were no deaths among patients during study treatment.
  ""Despite diagnostic and treatment advances, ovarian cancer remains the
deadliest gynecologic cancer, and the need for new therapeutic options that
prolong response remains critical,"" said David Barley, CEO of the National
Ovarian Cancer Coalition. ""The results of the NOVA trial are encouraging,
and could offer patients and their families a treatment option during the
stressful period that follows platinum-based chemotherapy where the majority
of patients receive no treatment.""

  About the Phase 3 ENGOT-OV16/NOVA Clinical Trial of Niraparib
  NOVA is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, international Phase 3 trial of
niraparib that enrolled 553 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who were
in a response to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients
were enrolled into one of two independent cohorts based on germline BRCA
mutation status. One cohort enrolled patients who were germline BRCA
mutation carriers (gBRCAmut), and the second cohort enrolled patients who
were not germline BRCA mutation carriers (non-gBRCAmut) and included
patients with HRD-positive and HRD-negative tumors. Within each cohort,
patients were randomized 2:1 to receive niraparib or placebo and were
treated continuously with placebo or 300 milligrams of niraparib, dosed as
three 100 milligram tablets once per day, until progression. The primary
endpoint of this study was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary
endpoints include patient-reported outcomes, chemotherapy-free interval
length, PFS 2, overall survival, and other measures of safety and
tolerability.  More information about this trial is available at
http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01847274.
  About Niraparib
  Niraparib is an oral, once-daily PARP inhibitor that is currently being

Therapeutic Profile
  PR Newswire
  EDISON, N.J., Oct. 13, 2016
  EDISON, N.J., Oct. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- ContraVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(NASDAQ: CTRV), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies, today reported positive
interim data for CMX157, the Company's highly potent prodrug of tenofovir,
from its ongoing Phase 2a multiple ascending dose clinical study.  The
head-to-head study is the first evaluation of CMX157 in HBV patients, and
directly compares CMX157 to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, Gilead's
Viread(R) ) in chronically infected hepatitis B (HBV) patients.
  Patients successfully completed both 5 mg and 10 mg cohorts, and interim
data reported below are from 10 HBV-infected patients who completed 14 days
of once-a-day oral dosing of 25 mg of CMX157, and two HBV patients treated
for 14 days of oral dosing with 300 mg TDF.  The CMX157 treated patients
showed an average 99% reduction in HBV viral load compared to baseline.
Significantly, the observed antiviral activity for CMX157 is comparable to
that observed in TDF-treated patients, but at 1/12(th) the dose (25 mg
CMX157 vs. standard 300 mg TDF).
  A key goal of this study was to monitor levels of active tenofovir in the
blood, exposure to which is a key predictor of off-target side effects.
Following oral dosing, levels of CMX157 and active tenofovir in the
bloodstream are approximately dose proportional and similar both in chronic
HBV patients as well as in an earlier healthy volunteer study. Notably,
CMX157 does not appear to break down readily into active tenofovir in the
blood (tenofovir: Cmax = 2.8 ng/mL; AUC = 34 ng*h/mL) in contrast to
patients taking Viread(R) (tenofovir: Cmax 340 ng/mL, AUC 1910 ng*h/mL). The
high levels of circulating tenofovir in subjects taking Viread(R) are
consistent with results from earlier published clinical studies of Viread(R)
in HIV and HBV patients.  These results are significant considering that
CMX157 achieved similar antiviral activity compared to Viread(R) while
significantly reducing systemic tenofovir exposure.
  Active tenofovir levels observed in blood following oral dosing of CMX157
are significantly below levels seen for Viread(R) -treated patients,
regardless of dose used, which is consistent with CMX157 targeting the liver
followed by activation of CMX157 specifically within the liver.  This is
further supported by the observation that viral load reductions with CMX157
are comparable to Viread(R) despite a significantly lower dose.
  ""We are pleased and excited with these clinical results, as they demonstrate
CMX157's great potential in our ongoing effort to develop a cure for HBV,""
said James Sapirstein, CEO of ContraVir.  ""The significant viral load
reduction and favorable safety at this low dose of CMX157 speaks to the
unique liver-targeting mechanism of our drug, which concentrates the
antiviral activity of tenofovir in the liver, enabling anti-HBV efficacy at
lower doses and minimal drug exposure to other tissues.  We believe, based
on the data that are being generated, that CMX157 has great potential as a
safe and highly potent backbone of combination therapy against HBV.""
  Pharmacokinetic data observed for CMX157 to date in healthy and HBV-infected
subjects are similar across the completed Phase 1b and ongoing Phase 2a
studies, consistent with the prodrug's site of action and anticipated
improved safety profile.  CMX157 was earlier found to be safe and well
tolerated at daily oral doses of up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers and is
presently demonstrating an excellent safety profile at 25 mg dose in the
ongoing Phase 2a study in HBV patients.  Upon completion of the 4-week
dosing regimen and independent safety review, dose escalation is planned to
continue at the 50 mg and 100 mg levels, respectively.  Similarity of
pharmacokinetic profiles observed for CMX157 in healthy and HBV-infected
subjects strongly suggests that the remaining 50 mg and 100 mg doses of
CMX157 in the ongoing Phase 2a study will also be safe and potentially even
more active against HBV.
  CMX157 Phase 2 Clinical Trial Design
  The Phase 2a multiple ascending dose clinical trial is designed to enroll 60
treatment-na&#239;ve patients with chronic HBV infection, and to compare
CMX157 to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, Gilead's Viread(R) ).  The
sequential dose escalation format consists of 10 patients per cohort
receiving four weeks of a once-daily dose of 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mg,
respectively, of CMX157, plus two patients per cohort receiving 300 mg of
TDF, the standard therapeutic dose of Viread(R) .
  About CMX157
  CMX157 is a highly potent analog of the successful antiviral drug tenofovir.
 Its novel liver-targeting structure results in decreased circulating levels
of tenofovir, lowering systemic exposure and thereby reducing the potential
for renal side effects.  CMX157 previously completed a Phase 1b dose
escalation clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers, in which
participants were treated at doses up to 100 mg per day for 14 days,
displaying an excellent safety, tolerability, and drug distribution profile.
 Based on CMX157's best-in-class potential, ContraVir believes CMX157 can
become the cornerstone of a curative combination therapy for hepatitis B.

  The interim analysis of Day 90 follow-up for all 501 patients, as well as
top-line data from Day 180 follow-up for up to 200 patients, will be
presented in a Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session at the AHA Scientific
Sessions 2016 on November 15, 2016 in New Orleans. In order to protect the
scientific integrity of the ongoing ORION-1 study, the Company does not
expect to provide additional information or make further public statements
regarding the results of the study in advance of the ORION-1 presentation at
the AHA Scientific Sessions. The Company anticipates that data from Day 180
follow-up in all 501 patients will be completed, analyzed and top-line
results disclosed before the end of 2016.
  About ORION-1
  ORION-1 is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, dose-finding
Phase 2 trial of single or multiple subcutaneous injections of PCSK9si in a
total of 501 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or
ASCVD-risk equivalents (e.g., diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia)
and elevated LDL-C despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering
therapies. The trial compares the effect of different doses of PCSK9si and
evaluates the potential for dosing no more than two, three or four times per
year.
  About PCSK9si (also known as ALN-PCSsc)
  PCSK9si is an investigational proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9
(PCSK9) synthesis inhibitor, which acts via RNA interference, being
developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 is a
genetically-validated protein regulator of LDL receptor metabolism. In
contrast to anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that bind to PCSK9 in
blood, PCSK9si is a first-in-class investigational medicine that acts by
inhibiting PCSK9 synthesis in the liver.
  In a previous, single-ascending dose study, PCSK9si was associated with
maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 88.7 percent with mean maximum knockdown of up to
82.3 +/- 2.0 percent and maximal LDL-C reduction of 78.1 percent with mean
maximum lowering of up to 59.3 +/- 5.0 percent. At Day 180, a single dose of
PCSK9si was associated with an up to 53 percent reduction in LDL-C, with a
least squares mean percent lowering of 47.0 percent in the 300 mg dose
cohort.
  In a previous multiple ascending dose study, PCSK9si was associated with
maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 94.4 percent with mean maximum knockdown of up to
88.5 +/- 1.6 percent and maximal LDL-C reduction of 83.0 percent with mean
maximum lowering of up to 64.4 +/- 5.4 percent.
  PCSK9si was generally well tolerated following single and multiple
subcutaneous dose administration, with no serious adverse events or
discontinuations due to adverse events.
  The Medicines Company and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals are collaborating in the
advancement of PCSK9si per their agreement formed in early 2013. Under the
terms of the agreement, Alnylam completed certain pre-clinical studies and
the Phase 1 clinical study, with The Medicines Company leading and funding
the development of PCSK9si from Phase 2 forward, as well as potential
commercialization.

The trial compares the effect of different doses of PCSK9si and evaluates the potential for dosing no more than two, three or four times per year.   About PCSK9si (also known as ALN-PCSsc)   PCSK9si is an investigational proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) synthesis inhibitor, which acts via RNA interference, being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 is a genetically-validated protein regulator of LDL receptor metabolism. In contrast to anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that bind to PCSK9 in blood, PCSK9si is a first-in-class investigational medicine that acts by inhibiting PCSK9 synthesis in the liver.   In a previous, single-ascending dose study, PCSK9si was associated with maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 88.7 percent with mean maximum knockdown of up to 82.3 +/- 2.0 percent and maximal LDL-C reduction of 78.1 percent with mean maximum lowering of up to 59.3 +/- 5.0 percent. At Day 180, a single dose of PCSK9si was associated with an up to 53 percent reduction in LDL-C, with a least squares mean percent lowering of 47.0 percent in the 300 mg dose cohort.   In a previous multiple ascending dose study, PCSK9si was associated with maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 94.4 percent with mean maximum knockdown of up to 88.5 +/- 1.6 percent and maximal LDL-C reduction of 83.0 percent with mean maximum lowering of up to 64.4 +/- 5.4 percent.   PCSK9si was generally well tolerated following single and multiple subcutaneous dose administration, with no serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events.   The Medicines Company and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals are collaborating in the advancement of PCSK9si per their agreement formed in early 2013. Under the terms of the agreement, Alnylam completed certain pre-clinical studies and the Phase 1 clinical study, with The Medicines Company leading and funding the development of PCSK9si from Phase 2 forward, as well as potential commercialization.

Alkermes plc (NASDAQ: ALKS) today announced positive topline results from FORWARD-5, the third phase 3 efficacy study to read out from the FORWARD pivotal program for ALKS 5461, a once-daily, oral investigational medicine with a novel mechanism of action for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies. The study met its prespecified primary endpoint showing treatment with ALKS 5461 significantly reduced symptoms of depression in patients with MDD compared to placebo. ALKS 5461 was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events observed for ALKS 5461 were nausea, dizziness and fatigue. Based on these results, along with the substantial data collected to date on the efficacy and safety of ALKS 5461 for the treatment of MDD, the company plans to request a meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Division of Psychiatric Products to discuss the filing strategy for this Fast Track designated medicine.

“We designed ALKS 5461 to have a novel mechanism of action for the treatment of MDD, a serious disease where new therapeutic options are highly sought after as millions of patients in the U.S. do not respond to standard courses of antidepressant therapy,” said Elliot Ehrich, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Alkermes. “With the successful completion of the FORWARD-5 study and data from more than 1,500 patients to date, we have established a strong foundation of evidence of ALKS 5461’s clinical utility in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. With these data now in hand, we will move forward rapidly to meet with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps toward a regulatory submission for ALKS 5461, with a goal of bringing this important new medication to patients with MDD.”

“ALKS 5461 embodies our dedication to developing novel and safe CNS medicines that address compelling unmet needs faced by large numbers of patients,” said Richard Pops, Chief Executive Officer of Alkermes. “Major depressive disorder affects millions of people and their families, and represents one of the greatest burdens of suffering and cost of any disease today. New drug development in the field is challenging and we are excited to advance ALKS 5461 in this important indication.”

In the study, ALKS 5461 2mg/2mg met the prespecified primary endpoint of significantly reducing depression scores compared to placebo, as measured by 6-item Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-6) scores (p=0.018). ALKS 5461 2mg/2mg also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in 10-item MADRS (MADRS-10) scores compared to placebo (p=0.026). The 1mg/1mg dose of ALKS 5461 showed improvement in depressive symptoms in the study, but did not separate significantly from placebo.

The most commonly reported adverse events for ALKS 5461 in the FORWARD-5 study were nausea, dizziness and fatigue. These findings are consistent with those observed in previously reported studies of ALKS 5461. Alkermes will present comprehensive data from FORWARD-5 at an upcoming medical meeting and submit the results for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

About the FORWARD-5 Study
FORWARD-5 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD) study that evaluated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two dose levels of ALKS 5461 (2mg/2mg and 1mg/1mg) as adjunctive treatment in patients with MDD who had an inadequate response to a stable dose of either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). The study randomized 407 subjects.

The study was conducted in two sequential stages: Stage 1 was 5 weeks in duration, Stage 2 was 6 weeks. In Stage 1, the average change from baseline depression scores was calculated for weeks 3 through 5. For Stage 2, the average change was calculated for weeks 3 through 6. The results of Stages 1 and 2 were then averaged. Depression scores were assessed using the 6-item Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-6) and MADRS-10. MADRS-6, a subscale of the MADRS-10 assessment tool for depression, focuses on the core symptoms of depression.

About the FORWARD Clinical Program
The FORWARD (Focused On Results With A Rethinking of Depression) pivotal program for ALKS 5461 includes three core phase 3 efficacy studies, as well as additional supportive studies to evaluate the long-term safety, dosing, pharmacokinetic profile and human abuse potential of ALKS 5461. FORWARD-5 is the third phase 3 efficacy study to read out from the FORWARD program. Results from FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 were announced in January 2016 and detailed data were presented at the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology (ASCP) in June 2016.

- Results Were Statistically Significant and Clinically Meaningful -

Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IONS) announced that SPINRAZATM (nusinersen), an investigational treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), met the primary endpoint at the interim analysis of CHERISH, the Phase 3 study evaluating SPINRAZA in later-onset (consistent with Type 2) SMA. The analysis found that children receiving SPINRAZA experienced a highly statistically significant improvement in motor function compared to those who did not receive treatment. SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable safety profile in the study.

“These results, along with our successful trial in infantile-onset SMA, reinforce the potential of SPINRAZA to benefit a broad range of SMA patients,” said Michael Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D., executive vice president, head of Research and Development at Biogen. “We will make regulators around the globe aware of this data and will continue working closely with them to bring SPINRAZA to families affected by SMA as quickly as possible.”

Biogen is preparing for the potential launch of SPINRAZA in the U.S. possibly as early as the end of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017.

Results From the CHERISH Interim Analysis

CHERISH is a fifteen-month study investigating SPINRAZA in 126 non-ambulatory patients with later-onset SMA (consistent with Type 2), including patients with the onset of signs and symptoms at greater than 6 months and an age of 2 to 12 years at screening.

Results from the primary endpoint of the pre-specified interim analysis demonstrated a difference of 5.9 points (p= 0.0000002) at 15 months between the treatment (n=84) and sham-controlled (n=42) study arms, as measured by the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). From baseline to 15 months of treatment, patients who received SPINRAZA achieved a mean improvement of 4.0 points in the HFMSE, while patients who were not on treatment declined by a mean of 1.9 points. The HFMSE is a reliable and validated tool specifically designed to assess motor function in children with SMA, and a change of three points or greater in the HFMSE has previously been identified as clinically meaningful. Data from the other endpoints analyzed were consistently in favor of children who received treatment. SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable safety profile. The majority of the adverse events were considered to be either related to SMA disease, common events in the general population, or events related to the lumbar puncture procedure. No patients discontinued the study.

With the positive interim analysis, the CHERISH study will be stopped and participants will be able to transition into the SHINE open-label extension study to receive SPINRAZA. Full study results will be presented at future medical congresses.

“These data further validate the potential of SPINRAZA as a treatment for patients with SMA,” said B. Lynne Parshall, chief operating officer of Ionis Pharmaceuticals. “We are grateful to all the families and clinicians who have participated in all of the SPINRAZA studies. Without their commitment and support, this program would not have been able to progress so quickly.”

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently accepted the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for SPINRAZA as a treatment for SMA and communicated they plan to act early on the NDA under an expedited review. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently validated Biogen’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in the EU. The EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted Accelerated Assessment status and the FDA granted Priority Review to SPINRAZA. Biogen is initiating regulatory filings in other countries in the coming months.

Biogen initiated a global expanded access program (EAP) in infantile-onset SMA earlier this year. The company will continue to explore where and when the EAP may be broadened to include patients with later-onset SMA (consistent with Type 2).

The SPINRAZA Clinical Trial Program

SPINRAZA has been studied in both presymptomatic and symptomatic patients with SMA including patients likely to develop or diagnosed with SMA Types 1, 2, and 3.

The SPINRAZA Phase 3 program is comprised of two registrational studies, ENDEAR and CHERISH. ENDEAR is a thirteen-month study investigating SPINRAZA in 122 patients with infantile-onset SMA, including patients with the onset of signs and symptoms of SMA at up to six months of age. The endpoint pre-specified for the interim analysis of the study evaluated the proportion of motor milestone responders from the motor component of the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE). Given the results of the positive interim analysis, the ENDEAR study is being stopped and participants are able to transition into the SHINE open-label study, in which all patients will receive SPINRAZA.

Additionally, the SHINE open-label extension study for patients who previously participated in ENDEAR or CHERISH is open and is intended to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of SPINRAZA.

Two additional Phase 2 studies, EMBRACE and NURTURE, were designed to collect additional data on SPINRAZA. EMBRACE is studying a small subset of patients with infantile or later-onset SMA who do not meet the age and other criteria of ENDEAR or CHERISH. NURTURE is an open-label, ongoing study in pre-symptomatic infants who are up to six weeks of age at time of first dose to determine if treatment before symptoms begin would prevent or delay the onset of SMA symptoms. An interim analysis of NURTURE showed that infants treated for up to one year with SPINRAZA achieved motor milestones in timelines more consistent with normal development than what is observed in the natural history of patients with Type 1 SMA. Three infants experienced adverse events considered possibly related to SPINRAZA, all of which resolved. In addition, no infants have discontinued or withdrawn from the study and no new safety concerns have been identified. NURTURE is currently active and enrolling. All studies are being conducted on a global scale.

About SMA1-5

Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. Ultimately, individuals with the most severe type of SMA can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing.

Due to a loss of, or defect in the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons. The severity of SMA correlates with the amount of SMN protein. People with Type 1 SMA, the most severe life-threatening form, produce very little SMN protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support or live beyond 2 years without respiratory support. People with Type 2 and Type 3 produce greater amounts of SMN protein and have less severe, but still life-altering forms of SMA.

Currently, there is no approved treatment for SMA.

To support awareness and education in SMA, Biogen has launched Together in SMA in the United States. Together in SMA is a program created to provide informational materials and resources to the SMA community. Learn more at www.TogetherinSMA.com.

About SPINRAZA (nusinersen)

SPINRAZA is an investigational, potentially disease-modifying therapy for the treatment of SMA that was discovered and developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, a leader in antisense therapeutics. SPINRAZA is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that is designed to alter the splicing of SMN2, a gene that is nearly identical to SMN1, in order to increase production of fully functional SMN protein.7

ASOs are short synthetic strings of nucleotides designed to selectively bind to target RNA and regulate gene expression. Through use of this technology, SPINRAZA has the potential to increase the amount of functional SMN protein in infants and children with SMA.

Both the U.S. and EU have granted SPINRAZA Orphan Drug status. Additionally, both the U.S. and EU regulatory agencies have granted special status to SPINRAZA, including Fast Track Designation and Priority Review in the U.S. and Accelerated Assessment in the EU.

Biogen exercised its option to worldwide rights to SPINRAZA in August 2016.

Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals acknowledge support from the following organizations for SPINRAZA: Cure SMA, Muscular Dystrophy Association, and SMA Foundation, intellectual property licensed from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the University of Massachusetts Medical School.

The analysis found that children receiving SPINRAZA experienced a highly statistically significant improvement in motor function compared to those who did not receive treatment. SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable safety profile in the study.  This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161107005392/en/  “These results, along with our successful trial in infantile-onset SMA, reinforce the potential of SPINRAZA to benefit a broad range of SMA patients,” said Michael Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D., executive vice president, head of Research and Development at Biogen. “We will make regulators around the globe aware of this data and will continue working closely with them to bring SPINRAZA to families affected by SMA as quickly as possible.”  Biogen is preparing for the potential launch of SPINRAZA in the U.S. possibly as early as the end of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017.  Results From the CHERISH Interim Analysis  CHERISH is a fifteen-month study investigating SPINRAZA in 126 non-ambulatory patients with later-onset SMA (consistent with Type 2), including patients with the onset of signs and symptoms at greater than 6 months and an age of 2 to 12 years at screening.  Results from the primary endpoint of the pre-specified interim analysis demonstrated a difference of 5.9 points (p= 0.0000002) at 15 months between the treatment (n=84) and sham-controlled (n=42) study arms, as measured by the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). From baseline to 15 months of treatment, patients who received SPINRAZA achieved a mean improvement of 4.0 points in the HFMSE, while patients who were not on treatment declined by a mean of 1.9 points. The HFMSE is a reliable and validated tool specifically designed to assess motor function in children with SMA, and a change of three points or greater in the HFMSE has previously been identified as clinically meaningful. Data from the other endpoints analyzed were consistently in favor of children who received treatment. SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable safety profile. The majority of the adverse events were considered to be either related to SMA disease, common events in the general population, or events related to the lumbar puncture procedure. No patients discontinued the study.  With the positive interim analysis, the CHERISH study will be stopped and participants will be able to transition into the SHINE open-label extension study to receive SPINRAZA. Full study results will be presented at future medical congresses.  “These data further validate the potential of SPINRAZA as a treatment for patients with SMA,” said B. Lynne Parshall, chief operating officer of Ionis Pharmaceuticals. “We are grateful to all the families and clinicians who have participated in all of the SPINRAZA studies. Without their commitment and support, this program would not have been able to progress so quickly.”  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently accepted the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for SPINRAZA as a treatment for SMA and communicated they plan to act early on the NDA under an expedited review. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently validated Biogen’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in the EU. The EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted Accelerated Assessment status and the FDA granted Priority Review to SPINRAZA. Biogen is initiating regulatory filings in other countries in the coming months.  Biogen initiated a global expanded access program (EAP) in infantile-onset SMA earlier this year. The company will continue to explore where and when the EAP may be broadened to include patients with later-onset SMA (consistent with Type 2).  The SPINRAZA Clinical Trial Program  SPINRAZA has been studied in both presymptomatic and symptomatic patients with SMA including patients likely to develop or diagnosed with SMA Types 1, 2, and 3.  The SPINRAZA Phase 3 program is comprised of two registrational studies, ENDEAR and CHERISH. ENDEAR is a thirteen-month study investigating SPINRAZA in 122 patients with infantile-onset SMA, including patients with the onset of signs and symptoms of SMA at up to six months of age. The endpoint pre-specified for the interim analysis of the study evaluated the proportion of motor milestone responders from the motor component of the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE). Given the results of the positive interim analysis, the ENDEAR study is being stopped and participants are able to transition into the SHINE open-label study, in which all patients will receive SPINRAZA.  Additionally, the SHINE open-label extension study for patients who previously participated in ENDEAR or CHERISH is open and is intended to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of SPINRAZA.  Two additional Phase 2 studies, EMBRACE and NURTURE, were designed to collect additional data on SPINRAZA. EMBRACE is studying a small subset of patients with infantile or later-onset SMA who do not meet the age and other criteria of ENDEAR or CHERISH. NURTURE is an open-label, ongoing study in pre-symptomatic infants who are up to six weeks of age at time of first dose to determine if treatment before symptoms begin would prevent or delay the onset of SMA symptoms. An interim analysis of NURTURE showed that infants treated for up to one year with SPINRAZA achieved motor milestones in timelines more consistent with normal development than what is observed in the natural history of patients with Type 1 SMA. Three infants experienced adverse events considered possibly related to SPINRAZA, all of which resolved. In addition, no infants have discontinued or withdrawn from the study and no new safety concerns have been identified. NURTURE is currently active and enrolling. All studies are being conducted on a global scale.  About SMA1-5  Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. Ultimately, individuals with the most severe type of SMA can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing.  Due to a loss of, or defect in the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons. The severity of SMA correlates with the amount of SMN protein. People with Type 1 SMA, the most severe life-threatening form, produce very little SMN protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support or live beyond 2 years without respiratory support. People with Type 2 and Type 3 produce greater amounts of SMN protein and have less severe, but still life-altering forms of SMA.  Currently, there is no approved treatment for SMA.  To support awareness and education in SMA, Biogen has launched Together in SMA in the United States. Together in SMA is a program created to provide informational materials and resources to the SMA community. Learn more at www.TogetherinSMA.com.  About SPINRAZA (nusinersen)  SPINRAZA is an investigational, potentially disease-modifying therapy for the treatment of SMA that was discovered and developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, a leader in antisense therapeutics. SPINRAZA is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that is designed to alter the splicing of SMN2, a gene that is nearly identical to SMN1, in order to increase production of fully functional SMN protein.7  ASOs are short synthetic strings of nucleotides designed to selectively bind to target RNA and regulate gene expression. Through use of this technology, SPINRAZA has the potential to increase the amount of functional SMN protein in infants and children with SMA.  Both the U.S. and EU have granted SPINRAZA Orphan Drug status. Additionally, both the U.S. and EU regulatory agencies have granted special status to SPINRAZA, including Fast Track Designation and Priority Review in the U.S. and Accelerated Assessment in the EU.  Biogen exercised its option to worldwide rights to SPINRAZA in August 2016.

  --Conference call to be held at 3:00 p.m., Eastern Time, today--
PARSIPPANY, N.J. &amp; CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 15, 2016--
  The Medicines Company (Nasdaq:MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(Nasdaq:ALNY) today announced positive results from the analysis of Day 90
data for 497 patients, as well as analysis of preliminary Day 180 data for
189 patients, enrolled in the ORION -1 Phase 2 study of inclisiran. Data
from ORION-1 were presented today in a Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session
at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2016 in New Orleans.
  Inclisiran (formerly known as PCSK9si or ALN-PCSsc) is an investigational
GalNAc-conjugated RNAi therapeutic targeting PCSK9--a genetically validated
protein regulator of LDL receptor metabolism--being developed for the
treatment of hypercholesterolemia.
  Inclisiran was generally well tolerated and no material safety issue was
observed, including no elevations of liver enzymes considered related to
study medication and no neuropathy or change in renal function. Overall
incidence of treatment emergent adverse events was 54% both in patients
randomized to placebo and in patients randomized to inclisiran, with no
differences between inclisiran doses. Injection site reactions (ISRs) with
inclisiran were infrequent (observed in 3.2% of patients), mild or moderate,
and transient - in only 2.4% of patients, the reported ISR started or was
still present 4 or more hours after dosing.
  Baseline LDL-C was approximately 130 mg/dL among 497 randomized and treated
patients. Among these patients, one 300 mg subcutaneous injection of
inclisiran achieved mean LDL-C reductions of 51% at Day 60, which were
durable to Day 90 (mean 45% and up to 76%). All differences relative to
placebo in these 497 patients were statistically significant (p <0.0001).
  Among 189 randomized and treated patients who had been followed for 180 days
or more by the interim data cut-off date of October 25, 2016, one 300 mg
subcutaneous injection of inclisiran achieved mean LDL-C reductions of 59%
at Day 60, which were durable to Day 90 (mean 50%) and Day 180 (mean 43% and
up to 81%). Two 300 mg injections of inclisiran - one given on Day 1 and one
on Day 90 - achieved a mean LDL-C reduction of 57% at Day 120, which was
durable to Day 180 (mean 52% and up to 81%). All differences relative to
placebo in these 189 patients were statistically significant (p <0.0001).
  ""The remarkable strength and consistency of the data from ORION-1 provide
compelling support for the medical and commercial potential of inclisiran
and drive our decision to move into Phase 3 with what we believe could be a
highly-competitive and potentially transformational medicine,"" said Clive
Meanwell, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of The Medicines Company. ""We
will focus our resources on inclisiran for aggressive Phase 3 development to
ensure that this promising agent is investigated thoroughly and rapidly in
Phase 3, submitted to worldwide regulatory agencies and, if approved, made
available to millions of at-risk, often non-adherent, patients worldwide who
continue to grapple with the realities and risks of high LDL-C.""
  David Kallend, MBBS, Vice President and Global Medical Director of The
Medicines Company, added, ""These positive results from ORION-1 showed robust
and durable knockdown of LDL-C and a very encouraging safety and
tolerability profile at this stage of development. The data strengthen our
earlier findings in Phase 1 - published recently in the New England Journal
of Medicine - that an infrequent, low volume dosing regimen of 2 or 3
injections per year could constitute a highly-differentiated and competitive
treatment for patients with hypercholesterolemia. Inclisiran also has the
potential to open new care approaches linking the temporal cycle of LDL-C
monitoring with counseling and administration of therapy. The ORION-1 data
have enabled us to select an optimal dose of 300 mg, and the data presage a
quick and efficient transition to Phase 3 development.""
  John J.P. Kastelein, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine and Chairman of the
Department of Vascular Medicine at the Academic Medical Center (AMC) of the
University of Amsterdam, said, ""Elevated LDL-C remains a major risk factor
for coronary artery disease, and new therapies are needed for patients who
are refractory or intolerant to current approaches for management of their
LDL-C levels. PCSK9 therapies have now emerged as a new class of drugs for
treatment of hypercholesterolemia, and I believe that these agents have the
potential to make a meaningful difference for patients. ORION-1 strengthens
prior data with inclisiran, especially the degree and durability of LDL-C
lowering effects. If the safety and efficacy of this novel investigational
PCSK9 synthesis inhibitor can be confirmed in Phase 3 studies to support
approval, it may offer an important treatment option for patients,
physicians, and payers.""
  John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam, added, ""We are
delighted with these data from the ORION development program for inclisiran
and thankful for the progress made by investigators and our partner, The
Medicines Company. We are very excited to see the rapid progression of the
program worldwide and are confident that our RNAi platform provides the
opportunity to create new medicines for important diseases such as
hypercholesterolemia, which have major unmet medical needs.""

  About ORION-1
  ORION-1 is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 2 study of
single or multiple subcutaneous injections of inclisiran in a total of 501
patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD-risk
equivalents (e.g., diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia) and elevated
LDL-C despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering therapies. The study
compares the effect of different doses of inclisiran and evaluates the
potential for an infrequent dosing regimen. The primary endpoint of the
study is the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline at Day 180.
  About Inclisiran
  Inclisiran (formerly known as PCSK9si or ALN-PCSsc) is an investigational
GalNAc-conjugated RNAi therapeutic targeting PCSK9 -- a genetically
validated protein regulator of LDL receptor metabolism -- being developed
for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In contrast to anti-PCSK9
monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that bind to PCSK9 in blood, inclisiran is a
first-in-class investigational medicine that acts by turning off PCSK9
synthesis in the liver.
  In a previous, single-ascending dose study, inclisiran was associated with
maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 88.7% with mean maximum knockdown of up to 82.3
+/- 2.0% and maximal LDL-C reduction of 78.1% with mean maximum lowering of
up to 59.3 +/- 5.0%. At Day 180, a single dose of inclisiran was associated
with an up to 53% reduction in LDL-C, with a least squares mean percent
lowering of 47.0% in the 300 mg dose cohort.
  In a previous multiple ascending dose study, inclisiran was associated with
maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 94.4% with mean maximum knockdown of up to 88.5
+/- 1.6% and maximal LDL-C reduction of 83.0% with mean maximum lowering of
up to 64.4 +/- 5.4%.
  Inclisiran was generally well tolerated following single and multiple
subcutaneous dose administration, with no serious adverse events or
discontinuations due to adverse events.
  The Medicines Company and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are collaborating in
the advancement of inclisiran per the companies' agreement formed in early
2013. Under the terms of the agreement, Alnylam completed certain
pre-clinical studies and the Phase 1 clinical study, with The Medicines
Company leading and funding the development of inclisiran from Phase 2
forward, as well as potential commercialization.

In a previous, single-ascending dose study, inclisiran was associated with maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 88.7% with mean maximum knockdown of up to 82.3 +/- 2.0% and maximal LDL-C reduction of 78.1% with mean maximum lowering of up to 59.3 +/- 5.0%. At Day 180, a single dose of inclisiran was associated with an up to 53% reduction in LDL-C, with a least squares mean percent lowering of 47.0% in the 300 mg dose cohort.   In a previous multiple ascending dose study, inclisiran was associated with maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 94.4% with mean maximum knockdown of up to 88.5 +/- 1.6% and maximal LDL-C reduction of 83.0% with mean maximum lowering of up to 64.4 +/- 5.4%.   Inclisiran was generally well tolerated following single and multiple subcutaneous dose administration, with no serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events.   The Medicines Company and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are collaborating in the advancement of inclisiran per the companies' agreement formed in early 2013. Under the terms of the agreement, Alnylam completed certain pre-clinical studies and the Phase 1 clinical study, with The Medicines Company leading and funding the development of inclisiran from Phase 2 forward, as well as potential commercialization.   About The Medicines Company   The Medicines Company is a biopharmaceutical company driven by an overriding purpose--to save lives, alleviate suffering and contribute to the economics of healthcare. The Company's mission is to create transformational solutions to address the most pressing healthcare needs facing patients, physicians and providers in three critical therapeutic areas: serious infectious disease care, cardiovascular care and surgery and perioperative care.

  INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 23, 2016
  INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 23, 2016 /CNW/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today
announced that solanezumab did not meet the primary endpoint in the
EXPEDITION3 clinical trial, a phase 3 study of solanezumab in people with
mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
  Patients treated with solanezumab did not experience a statistically
significant slowing in cognitive decline compared to patients treated with
placebo (p=.095), as measured by the ADAS-Cog(14) (Alzheimer's Disease
Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale).
  While the study results, including many secondary clinical endpoints,
directionally favored solanezumab, the magnitudes of treatment differences
were small. There were no new safety signals identified in the study. Lilly
will not pursue regulatory submissions for solanezumab for the treatment of
mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
  ""The results of the solanezumab EXPEDITION3 trial were not what we had hoped
for and we are disappointed for the millions of people waiting for a
potential disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease,"" said John C.
Lechleiter, Ph.D., chairman, president and chief executive officer, Lilly.
""We will evaluate the impact of these results on the development plans for
solanezumab and our other Alzheimer's pipeline assets.""
  Lilly will work with investigators to appropriately conclude the open-label
extensions for EXPEDITION, EXPEDITION2 and EXPEDITION3. The next steps for
the remaining elements of the solanezumab development program have not yet
been determined.
  ""Lilly is grateful for the dedication of the patients, their families, and
the clinical investigators who participated in this study,"" said Jan
Lundberg, Ph.D., executive vice president of science and technology and
president of Lilly Research Laboratories. ""Lilly remains committed to
Alzheimer's research as we have been for nearly 30 years, and our portfolio
includes many other promising approaches.""
  Lilly will present further findings from the study at the Clinical Trials on
Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) meeting on Thursday, December 8(th) at 9:15 p.m.
ET. The presentation will be shared live via webcast from the meeting. To
access the webcast, please visit http://www.ctad-alzheimer.com.
  ""Lilly has strong growth prospects without solanezumab,"" said David A.
Ricks, Lilly's incoming chief executive officer and president of Lilly
Bio-Medicines. ""Driven by new product launches, we continue to expect to
grow average annual revenue by at least 5 percent between 2015 and 2020.
Over that time frame, we also expect to increase our margins and provide
annual dividend increases to our shareholders.""
  The EXPEDITION3 study outcome is expected to result in a fourth-quarter
charge of approximately $150 million (pre-tax), or approximately $0.09 per
share (after-tax). The company will provide updated 2016 financial guidance
and announce its 2017 financial guidance on December 15, 2016 and will also
conduct a conference call with the investment community and media at 9:00
a.m. ET on that date, instead of on the originally-scheduled date of January

  About Solanezumab
  Solanezumab is Lilly's phase 3 monoclonal antibody being studied as a
potential therapy for people with mild cognitive impairment due to
Alzheimer's disease (EXPEDITION-PRO), preclinical Alzheimer's disease
(Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's ""A4""), and Dominantly
Inherited Alzheimer's Disease (""DIAN"").
  About EXPEDITION3
  EXPEDITION3 is a multinational, phase 3 trial of solanezumab in more than
2,100 patients diagnosed with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The
study includes an 18-month placebo-controlled period followed by an open
label extension. Enrollment was completed in 2015 and the last patient visit
for the placebo-controlled period occurred in October 2016. EXPEDITION3 is
the first phase 3 trial to evaluate only people with mild dementia due to
Alzheimer's disease.
  About Alzheimer's Disease
  Alzheimer's disease is a fatal illness that is believed to start with
changes in the brain that may begin 20 years or more before symptoms
appear.(1) Those changes cause a progressive decline in memory and other
aspects of cognition that eventually lead to dementia.
  Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia,
accounting for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases.(1) There are currently an
estimated 47 million people living with dementia worldwide.(2) The number of
people affected by dementia is expected to be nearly 75 million in 2030 and
131 million in 2050.(2) Estimates vary, but experts suggest that as many as
5.4 million Americans may have Alzheimer's disease.(1)

Phase 3 Studies Showing Significant Early Response and First-Line Efficacy
  HASBROUCK HEIGHTS, N.J., Nov. 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nymox
Pharmaceutical Corporation (NASDAQ:NYMX) is pleased to announce that new
Phase 3 prospective randomized clinical trial results have confirmed that
patients who received fexapotide as their initial treatment for BPH
(prostate enlargement) had superior efficacy results as early as 10 days
compared to control patients who received placebo or who had prior history
of other BPH medical treatments. These new Phase 3 results indicate that
fexapotide in these trials was highly efficacious for first-line treatment
of BPH.
  These findings are from analysis of the Company's extensive U.S. Phase 3
trials NX02-0017, NX02-0018, NX02-0020 and NX02-0022 including long-term
follow-ups that were undertaken from 2009 to 2016. These important results
come on top of many other positive results including successfully reaching
long-term primary efficacy endpoints, that have previously been reported.
The present prospective randomized trial results are new findings. 390
treatment naive patients with no past treatments for BPH had improvements
greater than previously treated BPH patients as early as 10 days
post-treatment (p<.02) and at one month (p<.04), 3 months (p<.001), six
months (p<.001), one year (p<.01) and at long-term (3.5 years) follow-up
(p<.003). The levels of mean change from baseline pre-treatment ranged from
6.49 to 8.88 points improvement in the AUA BPH Symptom Score. These
previously untreated patients who received a single injection of fexapotide
2.5 mg also had statistically significant superior improvements compared to
patients who received placebo treatments, as early as 10 days post-treatment
(p<.001) and at several time points also including the long-term (3.5 years)
follow-up extension (p<.001).
  Dr. Paul Averback, CEO of Nymox said, ""It is important to have now
demonstrated for Nymox's fexapotide, both 1. that it leads to an early onset
of clinically noticeable improvement; and 2. that it works well long-term as
a first-line therapeutic for men who have not tried other treatments before.
There is a major unmet need for a convenient, safe and efficacious treatment
for countless men worldwide with BPH who are unhappy with their symptoms and
who may be unhappy with their available choices.""
  Traditional BPH treatments have very undesirable side effects, particularly
causing frequent problems with ejaculation and overall sexual function, as
well as many other limiting side effects. Pills for BPH usually need to be
taken permanently to remain effective and surgical treatments for BPH often
produce permanent distortions of ejaculation as well as other risks. Middle
aged and elderly male patients often need a safer and more effective way to
manage these extremely common life problems.
  Nymox's lead drug fexapotide has been in development for over a decade and
has been tested by expert clinical trial investigative teams in over 70
distinguished clinical trial centers throughout the US, and has been found
after 7 years of prospective placebo controlled double blind studies of
treatment of 995 U.S. men with prostate enlargement to not only show
clinically meaningful and durable relief of BPH symptoms, but also to show a
major reduction in the incidence of prostate cancer, compared to placebo and
compared to the known and expected normal incidence of the disease. The same
clinical program conducted at the same highly regarded treatment centers
under rigorous trial scrutiny and performed strictly at arms-length by top
teams of clinical investigators across the country, has also shown in a
long-term blinded placebo crossover group study an 82-95% reduction in the
number of these patients who required surgery after they received crossover
fexapotide in the trial, as compared to patients who did not receive
fexapotide but instead received crossover conventional approved BPH
treatments (p<.0001). The aim of the crossover study was to determine the
clinical benefit fexapotide can provide to men who initially were double
blind randomized to and received placebo, remained blinded as to their
placebo treatment, and who subsequently required additional medical and/or
surgical treatment. In that study long-term outcomes were determined in 391
patients who were given double blind placebo injections, followed by
crossover to other treatments at the patients' discretion. The numbers of
blinded placebo patients who subsequently received surgical treatment during
the next 2-3 years for their BPH symptoms were then prospectively analyzed.
  For the earlier fexapotide Phase 3 long-term cancer incidence analysis, the
men in the study received fexapotide or placebo for the treatment of their
prostate enlargement (BPH) symptoms. All men were thoroughly evaluated at
expert urological testing investigational centers to exclude any prostate
cancer prior to qualifying for enrollment in the studies. The participants
were followed for up to 7 years (median of 5 years) after treatment. The
study analyzed all cases of prostate cancer that were subsequently
diagnosed. The expected rate of new prostate cancer in the U.S. general male
population in this age group is in the 5-20% range after 7 years. In the BPH
population in published large trials of drugs for the prevention of prostate
cancer, the incidence of new prostate cancer cases after 4-7 years has been
reported in major studies to be 20-25%. The data analysis from the Nymox
fexapotide study showed a statistically significant and very low incidence
of 1.3% for prostate cancer in this comparable fexapotide treated BPH
population. By comparison, for example in a population of patients with
erectile dysfunction treated with PDE5 inhibitor drugs after 4 years the
rate of subsequent prostate cancer was 19.5% (and 22.7% in controls) as
recently reported in a large U.S. study published in the Journal of Urology
(Volume 196; 3, 2016). The quoted study was in a population of middle aged
and elderly men without prostate cancer, similar to the Nymox study
population.
  Nymox recently announced (October 11, 2016) positive long-term results in
344 patients who were given a single repeat fexapotide treatment after
initial blinded treatment with fexapotide or placebo. Patients were followed
for 2 to 6.5 years (mean 4.2 years) after initial treatment and showed
long-term statistically significant symptomatic improvement (mean
improvement of 6.5 points in the AUA BPH Symptom Score) compared to Phase 3
patients who received placebo alone (p<.001). Repeat injection was found to
be safe with no significant drug related toxicities or side effects found in
the study.
  Nymox has completed the execution of seven Phase 3 U.S. BPH clinical
protocols, including 2 prospective randomized multicenter single injection
double blind clinical trials; 2 U.S. repeat injection clinical trials; and 3
U.S. blinded long-term clinical trial extension studies. In addition, a
number of Phase 3 safety and clinical pharmacology studies and analyses have
been completed.

These new Phase 3 results indicate that fexapotide in these trials was highly efficacious for first-line treatment of BPH.   These findings are from analysis of the Company's extensive U.S. Phase 3 trials NX02-0017, NX02-0018, NX02-0020 and NX02-0022 including long-term follow-ups that were undertaken from 2009 to 2016. These important results come on top of many other positive results including successfully reaching long-term primary efficacy endpoints, that have previously been reported. The present prospective randomized trial results are new findings. 390 treatment naive patients with no past treatments for BPH had improvements greater than previously treated BPH patients as early as 10 days post-treatment (p<.02) and at one month (p<.04), 3 months (p<.001), six months (p<.001), one year (p<.01) and at long-term (3.5 years) follow-up (p<.003). The levels of mean change from baseline pre-treatment ranged from 6.49 to 8.88 points improvement in the AUA BPH Symptom Score. These previously untreated patients who received a single injection of fexapotide 2.5 mg also had statistically significant superior improvements compared to patients who received placebo treatments, as early as 10 days post-treatment (p<.001) and at several time points also including the long-term (3.5 years) follow-up extension (p<.001).   Dr. Paul Averback, CEO of Nymox said, ""It is important to have now demonstrated for Nymox's fexapotide, both 1. that it leads to an early onset of clinically noticeable improvement; and 2. that it works well long-term as a first-line therapeutic for men who have not tried other treatments before. There is a major unmet need for a convenient, safe and efficacious treatment for countless men worldwide with BPH who are unhappy with their symptoms and who may be unhappy with their available choices.""   Traditional BPH treatments have very undesirable side effects, particularly causing frequent problems with ejaculation and overall sexual function, as well as many other limiting side effects. Pills for BPH usually need to be taken permanently to remain effective and surgical treatments for BPH often produce permanent distortions of ejaculation as well as other risks. Middle aged and elderly male patients often need a safer and more effective way to manage these extremely common life problems.   Nymox's lead drug fexapotide has been in development for over a decade and has been tested by expert clinical trial investigative teams in over 70 distinguished clinical trial centers throughout the US, and has been found after 7 years of prospective placebo controlled double blind studies of treatment of 995 U.S. men with prostate enlargement to not only show clinically meaningful and durable relief of BPH symptoms, but also to show a major reduction in the incidence of prostate cancer, compared to placebo and compared to the known and expected normal incidence of the disease. The same clinical program conducted at the same highly regarded treatment centers under rigorous trial scrutiny and performed strictly at arms-length by top teams of clinical investigators across the country, has also shown in a long-term blinded placebo crossover group study an 82-95% reduction in the number of these patients who required surgery after they received crossover fexapotide in the trial, as compared to patients who did not receive fexapotide but instead received crossover conventional approved BPH treatments (p<.0001). The aim of the crossover study was to determine the clinical benefit fexapotide can provide to men who initially were double blind randomized to and received placebo, remained blinded as to their placebo treatment, and who subsequently required additional medical and/or surgical treatment. In that study long-term outcomes were determined in 391 patients who were given double blind placebo injections, followed by crossover to other treatments at the patients' discretion. The numbers of blinded placebo patients who subsequently received surgical treatment during the next 2-3 years for their BPH symptoms were then prospectively analyzed.   For the earlier fexapotide Phase 3 long-term cancer incidence analysis, the men in the study received fexapotide or placebo for the treatment of their prostate enlargement (BPH) symptoms. All men were thoroughly evaluated at expert urological testing investigational centers to exclude any prostate cancer prior to qualifying for enrollment in the studies. The participants were followed for up to 7 years (median of 5 years) after treatment. The study analyzed all cases of prostate cancer that were subsequently diagnosed.

  TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  VBL Therapeutics
(NASDAQ:VBLT), today announced top-line results from its exploratory Phase 2
study of VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) in patients with advanced,
differentiated thyroid cancer. As previously announced, this trial met its
primary endpoint, which was defined as 25% progression-free survival at 6
months (PFS-6), in heavily-pretreated patients with late-stage disease. A
dose-dependent response was seen, with 35% of patients reaching PFS-6 in the
therapeutic dose cohort, versus 25% in a low-dose cohort. Given this
positive clinical response, the Company continued to follow patients for
overall survival (OS) data, which was not a primary endpoint. Although the
trial included a small number of patients and was not powered to show OS
differences, the new data show a dose-response and evidence of an overall
survival benefit in the cohort of patients treated with multiple therapeutic
doses of VB-111, compared to patients who received a single low dose of
VB-111 (mOS 761 days versus 469 days; p=0.096).  Only one patient remained
alive in the low-dose cohort, compared to a tail of about 50% in the high
dose group.

  ""The appearance of dose-dependent superior overall survival provides
encouragement, especially given that this trial enrolled patients with
late-stage disease whose tumors were resistant to multiple lines of previous
therapies,"" said Keith C. Bible, MD, PhD, Professor of Oncology, Division of
Medical Oncology, Department of Oncology, and Endocrine Malignancies Disease
Oriented Group, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, and Primary Investigator for this
trial.
  ""This is the third indication in which we have seen profound clinical
responses and evidence of an overall survival benefit with VB-111,"" said
Dror Harats, MD, Chief Executive Officer of VBL Therapeutics. ""Following our
Phase 2 OS data in recurrent GBM and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, this
trial, which evaluated VB-111 as monotherapy, reinforces the potential of
VB-111 and its unique mechanism of action, for multiple solid tumor
indications. We are continuing to focus on completion of our clinical
program, and potentially commercialization, of VB-111 for rGBM, and to
advance our ovarian cancer clinical program.  Based on the current data, we
may expand our program to additional indications, such as thyroid cancer,
either independently in the future, or earlier in collaboration with a
strategic partner,"" added Prof. Harats.
  The open-label dose-escalating study enrolled patients with advanced,
recently-progressive, differentiated thyroid cancer that is unresponsive to
radioactive iodine, in two cohorts. The majority of patients had tumors
which had failed on several therapeutic lines, including tyrosine kinase
inhibitors, prior to enrollment. In the first cohort twelve patients
received a single intravenous infusion of VB-111 at a low dose of 3X10(12)
viral particles (VPs). The second cohort included seventeen patients, who
received VB-111 at a therapeutic dose of 10(13) VPs every two months until
disease progression. The company previously reported that 35% of patients in
the therapeutic dose cohort (n=17) met the primary endpoint of 6-month
progression-free survival using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST), compared to 25% of patients in the low dose cohort. PFS at 12
months was 25% in the VB-111 high dose cohort, versus 0% in the low dose
cohort.  Continued follow-up now indicates further survival benefit for the
multiple-dose therapeutic cohort, with median OS of 761 versus 469 in the
low-dose cohort (p=0.096).  VB-111 was well-tolerated in this study, with no
signs of clinically significant safety issues.
  About Thyroid Cancer
  Thyroid cancer occurs in the thyroid gland, a hormone-producing organ at the
base of the neck that regulates heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature
and weight. According to the National Cancer Institute, there are an
estimated 535,000 people currently living with thyroid cancer in the United
States, with an estimated 60,000 new cases each year and an estimated 1,850
annual deaths as a result of the disease. The type of treatment depends on
the cancer cell type, tumor size and severity of the disease. First-line
treatment is surgical removal of the thyroid gland, and is recommended for
most patients. Treatment with radioactive iodine after surgery to destroy
any remaining thyroid tissue may be recommended for more advanced disease.
If radioactive iodine is ineffective, other treatments are prescribed, such
tyrosine kinase inhibitors and systemic chemotherapy. However, if such
treatments are unsuccessful, the therapeutic options for patients are
currently very limited.
  About VBL
  Vascular Biogenics Ltd., operating as VBL Therapeutics, is a clinical stage
biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and
commercialization of first-in-class treatments for cancer. The Company's
lead oncology product candidate, ofranergene obadenovec (VB-111), is a
first-in-class, targeted anti-cancer gene-therapy agent that is positioned
to treat a wide range of solid tumors. It is conveniently administered as an
IV infusion once every two months. It has been observed to be well-tolerated
in >200 cancer patients and we have observed its efficacy signals in an ""all
comers"" Phase 1 trial as well as in three tumor-specific Phase 2 studies.
Ofranergene obadenovec is currently being studied in a Phase 3 pivotal trial
for recurrent Glioblastoma, conducted under an FDA Special Protocol
Assessment (SPA).
  About Ofranergene Obadenovec (VB-111)
  ofranergene obadenovec is a unique biologic agent that uses a dual mechanism
to target solid tumors. Based on a non-integrating, non-replicating, Adeno 5
vector, ofranergene obadenovec utilizes VBL's proprietary Vascular Targeting
System (VTS(TM)) to target the tumor vasculature for cancer therapy. Unlike
anti-VEGF or TKIs, ofranergene obadenovec does not aim to block a specific
pro-angiogenic pathway; instead, it uses an angiogenesis-specific sensor
(VBL's PPE-1-3x proprietary promoter) to specifically induce cell death in
angiogenic endothelial cells in the tumor milieu. This mechanism retains
activity regardless of baseline tumor mutations or the identity of the
pro-angiogenic factors secreted by the tumor and shows efficacy even after
failure of prior treatment with other anti-angiogenics. Moreover,
ofranergene obadenovec induces specific anti-tumor immune response, which is
accompanied by recruitment of CD8 T-cells and apoptosis of tumor cells.
  Ofranergene obadenovec completed a Phase 2 study in rGBM, which showed a
statistically significant improvement in overall survival in patients
treated with ofranergene obadenovec through progression, compared to either
patients treated with ofranergene obadenovec followed by bevacizumab alone,
or to historical bevacizumab data. In a Phase 2 trial for recurrent
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, ofranergene obadenovec demonstrated a
statistically significant increase in overall survival and 60% durable
response rate (as measured by reduction in CA-125), approximately 2x the
historical response with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in ovarian cancer.
In a Phase 2 study in recurrent, iodine-resistant differentiated thyroid
cancer, ofranergene obadenovec met the primary endpoint and provided
evidence of disease stabilization and a positive safety profile. Ofranergene
obadenovec has received Fast Track Designation for recurrent glioblastoma in
the U.S. and orphan drug status for glioblastoma in both the U.S. and EU.

CERC,11/29/16,Biotech,Clinical,MarketWired,S.IW CERC .NASDAQ MHHE.IW .MEDICAL PBBI.IW .PHARMA,Cerecor Reports Top-Line Data from CERC-301 Phase 2 Study for Major Depressive Disorder,"BALTIMORE, MD--(Marketwired - November 29, 2016) - Cerecor Inc. (NASDAQ: CERC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatments to make a difference in the lives of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, today announced top-line clinical results from its major depressive disorder (MDD) Phase 2 clinical trial (Clin301-203) of adjunctive treatment of CERC-301, an oral, NR2B specific, NMDA receptor antagonist. Overall, the trial failed to demonstrate efficacy on the primary endpoint for mean improvement in Bech-6, a subset of the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDRS-17), averaged over days 2 and 4 post dose. However, the study showed signals for the CERC-301 20 mg dose group at Day 2, at pre-specified secondary endpoints, indicating a potentially clinically-meaningful effect, though not statistically significant, on the Bech-6 and HDRS-17.

The trial was a 3-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD) study of intermittent doses of adjunctive CERC-301 (12 mg or 20 mg) or placebo in the treatment of subjects with MDD who have not adequately responded to antidepressant therapy, either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin norepinephrine uptake inhibitor (SNRI).

The study randomized 115 subjects. The study was conducted in two sequential one week periods. Placebo non-responders in Period 1 were re-randomized to either study drug or placebo in Period 2. Subjects received treatment at the beginning of each period. The results of Periods 1 and 2 were averaged. The study included a one-week follow-up.

In this SPCD designed study, the mean improvement from baseline on the Bech-6 scale averaged over Days 2 and 4 post treatment for Period 1 was 3.82 for placebo, 2.50 for the 12 mg dose and 4.11 for the 20 mg dose, and for Period 2 was 2.86 for placebo, 1.64 for the 12mg dose and 3.38 for the 20 mg dose. The weighted average for the difference in placebo and drug improvement (placebo minus drug) was +1.45 and -0.04 for 12 mg and 20 mg CERC-301, respectively.

In a pre-specified analysis of the mean improvement from baseline on the Bech-6 at Day 2 for Period 1 was 3.59 for placebo, 4.71 for 20 mg; and for Period 2, 2.30 for placebo and 3.52 for 20 mg. In another pre-specified analysis of the mean improvement from baseline on the HDRS-17 at Day 2 for Period 1 was 6.24 for placebo and 9.71 for 20 mg; and for Period 2, 3.60 for placebo and 5.38 for 20 mg.

Significant improvement was not observed on the other secondary endpoints evaluated to date.

Consistent with previous trials, CERC-301 was generally well-tolerated with no SAEs reported and no discontinuations due to AEs. The most commonly reported adverse events in the study were increased blood pressure, dizziness, somnolence and paresthesia.

""While the trial failed to achieve the primary efficacy endpoint, we note that these results suggest a potentially clinically meaningful treatment effect in the 20 mg dose at Day 2,"" added Ronald Marcus, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Regulatory Affairs at Cerecor.

""Based on this well conducted and controlled clinical trial, we continue to believe that adjunctive CERC-301 may have the potential to reduce depressive symptoms very rapidly with the added patient convenience of oral dosing,"" said Dr. Uli Hacksell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cerecor. ""We intend to more fully assess the results from this trial as we continue to receive the remaining data sets over the coming weeks and will announce planned next steps for CERC-301 at a later time.""

""From a clinician's perspective, these data warrant additional clinical testing to fully explore the potential for this compound to treat MDD,"" said Dr. Maurizio Fava, Director, Division of Clinical Research of the Massachusetts General Hospital Research Institute & Executive Vice Chair, Department of Psychiatry. ""I would note that a minimum of 2 points of improvement on the HDRS-17 scale compared to placebo is considered by many, and noted in MDD studies, to be clinically meaningful.""

Cerecor intends to present additional data from this trial at scientific meetings in 2017.

- Conference Call and Webcast Today at 4:30 p.m. EST

Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ARWR) today announced a strategic redeployment of resources to support the development of RNAi therapeutics that utilize the company’s new proprietary subcutaneous (subQ) and extra-hepatic delivery systems. Arrowhead will discontinue development of clinical stage drug candidates ARC-520, ARC-521, and ARC-AAT, which utilize the DPCiv™, or EX1, delivery vehicle. The company is hosting a conference call at 4:30 p.m. EST to discuss this decision.

Arrowhead remains committed to finding therapeutic options for patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). The company intends to advance to the clinic two previously unannounced HBV and AATD programs using our subQ platform. Arrowhead has learned a great deal during prior HBV and AAT studies that will help drive the subQ programs efficiently.

Existing preclinical subQ and extra-hepatic programs such as ARC-LPA and ARC-AMG1, which are partnered with Amgen, ARC-F12, ARC-HIF2, and other unannounced programs are not affected by this decision.

Because of the discontinuation of its existing clinical programs, the company is reducing its workforce by approximately 30%, while maintaining full resourcing necessary to support current and potential future partner-based programs and Arrowhead’s burgeoning pipeline. This more streamlined structure should enable the company to continue to develop its programs rapidly, and is intended to extend its cash runway into 2019.

The decision to discontinue development of EX1-containing programs was based primarily on two factors. First, during ongoing discussions with regulatory agencies and outside experts, it became apparent that there would be substantial delays in all clinical programs that utilize EX1, while the company further explored the cause of deaths in a non-clinical toxicology study in non-human primates. Second, Arrowhead has made substantial advances in RNA chemistry and targeting resulting in large potency gains for subQ administered and extra-hepatic RNAi-based development programs. In preclinical studies with the subQ platform, the company has obtained depth and duration of target gene knockdown approaching that of intravenously administered EX1-containing candidates, at lower doses and with good safety margins.

The company believes it is prudent to focus its development resources entirely on its subQ and extra-hepatic pipeline, which includes programs in HBV, AAT, Factor 12, HIF-2alpha, and other unannounced programs. In addition to its own pipeline, Arrowhead is also focused on providing full resources to support its partnership with Amgen and potential future partnerships for its subQ and extra-hepatic delivery systems.

The tolerability of ARC-520, ARC-521, and ARC-AAT in human clinical trials appeared to be favorable, and in the company’s view, supported advancing the programs. EX1-containing candidates have been administered over 800 times in more than 300 human study subjects and patients and have been generally well tolerated, with a small minority (6%) of infusions being associated with infusion reactions. In addition, across the ARC-520, ARC-521, and ARC-AAT clinical programs, laboratory values have not been deemed indicative of drug induced organ toxicity.

In addition, each candidate was highly active against its respective target. For example, data presented earlier this month at The Liver Meeting® show that ARC-AAT achieved 90% knockdown of serum AAT, which is believed to be near full suppression of liver production of the protein, in a Phase 1 clinical study. For ARC-520, it was previously reported that reductions in surface antigen (HBsAg) of almost 99%, or 2 logs, were achieved after a single dose. In subsequent multiple dose studies, for which data have not yet been reported, reductions of almost 3 logs were observed, with several patients being tracked that appear poised to possibly seroclear HBsAg, representing potential function cures.

However, due to likely regulatory considerations, as of this announcement all patient recruitment for ARC-520, ARC-521, and ARC-AAT has been halted and dosing discontinued. The company will work together with investigators and clinical sites to ensure a smooth transition of study closure and patient medical care.

Society of Urological Oncology Annual Meeting
  DURHAM, N.C., Nov. 30, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heat Biologics, Inc.
(Nasdaq:HTBX), a leader in the development of gp96-based immunotherapies
that are designed to activate a patient's immune system to fight cancer,
announced that it presented topline data from its 94-patient Phase II trial
evaluating HS-410 (vesigenurtacel-L) in combination with standard of care,
Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#233;rin (BCG), or as a monotherapy, for the treatment
of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, at the Society of Urologic Oncology
Annual Meeting in San Antonio, TX.
  In the poster, ""Top-Line Results from Vesigenurtacel-L (HS-410) in
Combination with BCG from a Randomized, Blinded Phase 2 Trial in Patients
with Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC),"" researchers reported that
there were encouraging signs of anti-tumor activity as HS-410 generated a
robust antigen-specific immune response to multiple tumor-associated
peptides in treated patients, while there were no immune responses of this
type in the placebo.  However, these responses did not translate into
clinical outcomes, and there was no statistically significant difference in
the primary endpoint (proportion of recurrence-free survival at one year)
between the vaccine and placebo arms of the trial. To better assess the
durability of the positive immunological responses, and in keeping with
clinical trial guidance recently issued by International Bladder Cancer
Group (""IBCG"")(1) recommending a 2-year study duration for NMIBC trials,
Heat will continue to monitor all patients enrolled in the study for an
additional 12 months. At that time, Heat will make a final determination
whether to progress its bladder cancer program into a Phase 3 trial.
  ""The ability of HS-410 to prime T-cells suggests a strong signal that the
vaccine is having an impact, as well as an opportunity to improve responses,
in this challenging disease,"" said study principal investigator, Gary
Steinberg, M.D., The Bruce and Beth White Family Professor of Surgery and
Director of Urologic Oncology at the University of Chicago. ""Historically,
NMIBC has been very difficult to treat, with BCG being the only approved
therapy in the past 40 years. We were surprised to see that all arms of this
trial performed much better than historical control, which is a testament to
improvements in standard of care, and validates our choice to run a
controlled clinical trial. We look forward to continuing to monitor patients
in this trial, per IBCG recommendations. and would like to thank the many
patients and their families for the commitment to this trial and advancement
of the treatment of bladder cancer.""
  ""We were pleased to see a robust antigen-specific immune response,
reinforcing our earlier clinical data,"" Jeff Wolf, CEO of Heat Biologics,
commented. ""Even though we did not achieve our desired clinical outcomes, we
are encouraged by the results and believe this, and other combination
therapies, have the potential to improve long-term outcomes. In particular,
Heat's ComPACT technology, combining a therapeutic vaccine with an immune
co-stimulator in a single product, was designed to substantially improve
immune response durability. We are actively pursuing new programs to
complement our existing platforms, which we expect to announce in early
2017. Moreover, we look forward to examining the additional top-line data
that will be reported next week for our combination trial of HS-110 in with
Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo(R) (nivolumab) in lung cancer.""
  ""HS-410 stimulated antigen-specific immune responses to multiple
tumor-associated peptides,"" commented Taylor Schreiber, M.D., Ph.D., Chief
Scientific Officer. ""The kinetics of these responses indicate efficient
priming of CD8+ T cells, consistent with results seen in other Heat
Biologics clinical trials. Remaining analyses are in progress to inform
future development of other agents and/or combinations aimed at improving
immune response durability. Further understanding of the secondary and
exploratory endpoints will advise future development steps.""

  About Heat Biologics, Inc.
  Heat Biologics, Inc. (Nasdaq:HTBX) is an immuno-oncology company developing
novel therapies that are designed to activate a patient's immune system
against cancer utilizing an engineered form of gp96, a protein that
activates the immune system when cells die. Heat's highly specific T
cell-stimulating therapeutic vaccine platform technologies, ImPACT and
ComPACT, form the basis of its product candidates. These platforms, in
combination with other therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, are
designed to address three distinct, but synergistic mechanisms of action:
robust activation of CD8+ ""killer"" T cells (one of the human immune system's
most potent weapons against cancer); reversal of tumor-induced immune
suppression; and T cell co-stimulation to further enhance patients' immune
response.  Currently, Heat is conducting a Phase 2 trial with HS-410
(vesigenurtacel-L) in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer
(NMIBC) and a Phase 1b trial with HS-110 (viagenpumatucel-L) in combination
with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor to treat patients with non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC).
  Heat's wholly-owned subsidiary, Zolovax, Inc., is developing therapeutic and
preventative vaccines to treat infectious diseases based on Heat's gp96
vaccine technology, with a current focus on the development of a Zika
vaccine, in conjunction with the University of Miami. The Zolovax patent
portfolio also includes gp96 vaccines targeting Zika and West Nile virus,
Dengue and yellow fever among others.

However, these responses did not translate into clinical outcomes, and there was no statistically significant difference in the primary endpoint (proportion of recurrence-free survival at one year) between the vaccine and placebo arms of the trial. To better assess the durability of the positive immunological responses, and in keeping with clinical trial guidance recently issued by International Bladder Cancer Group (""IBCG"")(1) recommending a 2-year study duration for NMIBC trials, Heat will continue to monitor all patients enrolled in the study for an additional 12 months. At that time, Heat will make a final determination whether to progress its bladder cancer program into a Phase 3 trial.   ""The ability of HS-410 to prime T-cells suggests a strong signal that the vaccine is having an impact, as well as an opportunity to improve responses, in this challenging disease,"" said study principal investigator, Gary Steinberg, M.D., The Bruce and Beth White Family Professor of Surgery and Director of Urologic Oncology at the University of Chicago. ""Historically, NMIBC has been very difficult to treat, with BCG being the only approved therapy in the past 40 years. We were surprised to see that all arms of this trial performed much better than historical control, which is a testament to improvements in standard of care, and validates our choice to run a controlled clinical trial. We look forward to continuing to monitor patients in this trial, per IBCG recommendations. and would like to thank the many patients and their families for the commitment to this trial and advancement of the treatment of bladder cancer.""   ""We were pleased to see a robust antigen-specific immune response, reinforcing our earlier clinical data,"" Jeff Wolf, CEO of Heat Biologics, commented. ""Even though we did not achieve our desired clinical outcomes, we are encouraged by the results and believe this, and other combination therapies, have the potential to improve long-term outcomes. In particular, Heat's ComPACT technology, combining a therapeutic vaccine with an immune co-stimulator in a single product, was designed to substantially improve immune response durability. We are actively pursuing new programs to complement our existing platforms, which we expect to announce in early 2017. Moreover, we look forward to examining the additional top-line data that will be reported next week for our combination trial of HS-110 in with Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo(R) (nivolumab) in lung cancer.""   ""HS-410 stimulated antigen-specific immune responses to multiple tumor-associated peptides,"" commented Taylor Schreiber, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer. ""The kinetics of these responses indicate efficient priming of CD8+ T cells, consistent with results seen in other Heat Biologics clinical trials. Remaining analyses are in progress to inform future development of other agents and/or combinations aimed at improving immune response durability. Further understanding of the secondary and exploratory endpoints will advise future development steps.""   ""We conducted a cost-efficient trial and will continue to gather important data with minimal ongoing costs,"" Mr. Wolf added.

Session: Plenary Session 7

The open-label Phase 1 CRB-401 study (NCT02658929) is investigating the administration of bb2121 anti-BCMA CAR T cells in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. The primary endpoint of the study is incidence of adverse events (AEs) and abnormal laboratory test results, including dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The study also seeks to assess disease-specific response criteria including: complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), and partial response (PR) according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma. The study also seeks to determine the recommended dose for further clinical trials. Patients on study were heavily pre-treated, with a median of six prior therapies (range: 5 - 13). As of the November 18th, 2016 data cut-off, 11 patients had been enrolled and dosed in four dose cohorts: 5.0 x 107, 15.0 x 107, 45.0 x 107 and 80 x 107 CAR+ T cells. All 11 dosed patients were evaluable for safety, and the first nine patients (5.0 x 107, 15.0 x 107, 45.0 x 107 dose cohorts) have undergone their first multiple myeloma tumor restaging and were evaluable for efficacy. This study is currently enrolling patients at seven sites in the U.S., with an anticipated total enrollment of 50 patients.

Patients received a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by an infusion of bb2121 anti-BCMA CAR T cells. The CAR T cells were produced from each patient’s own blood cells, which were modified using a lentiviral vector encoding the anti-BCMA CAR.

Avastin(R) Combination in Relapsed Renal Cell Carcinoma
  CRLX101 plus Avastin Does Not Show Improvement Compared to Standard of Care
in this Setting
  Company to Host Conference Call Today at 4:30 pm EDT
WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 17, 2016--
  Cerulean Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ:CERU), a clinical-stage company developing
nanoparticle-drug conjugates (NDCs), today announced top-line results from
the Company's Phase 2, randomized, multi-center clinical trial of its lead
candidate, CRLX101, in combination with Avastin(R) (bevacizumab) in the
treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
  The trial was conducted at 43 sites in the US and South Korea, and enrolled
115 patients with RCC who progressed through two or three prior lines of
therapy. Patients were randomized to receive CRLX101 in combination with
Avastin or investigator's choice standard of care (SOC) therapy. SOC agents
included axitinib, bevacizumab, everolimus, pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib,
and temsirolimus. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS)
in the clear cell population (n=102) assessed by independent radiological
review. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, duration of
response and overall survival.
  The study demonstrated no statistically significant difference in median PFS
and objective response rate for the CRLX101 combination compared to SOC.
Median PFS was 3.7 months for the CRLX101 combination compared with a median
PFS of 3.9 months for SOC (hazard ratio: 1.25, p=0.822). The 95% confidence
interval for PFS for the CRLX101 combination was 2.0 months to 4.3 months
and for SOC was 2.2 months to 5.4 months. Objective response rate by
independent radiological review for patients who received the CRLX101
combination was 5% (2/42) compared to 14% (6/43) for SOC (p=0.836). The
CRLX101 and Avastin combination appeared to be safe and well-tolerated and
the safety and tolerability profile of the combination was consistent with
that observed in previous studies. The full data set from the trial are
expected to be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical conference.

  ""We are disappointed with this outcome and will undertake a thorough
analysis of the data to understand why CRLX101 plus Avastin underperformed
compared to the results we saw in an earlier investigator-sponsored trial,""
said Christopher D. T. Guiffre, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Cerulean. ""This outcome did not support our hypothesis that targeting
hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) in combination with VEGF inhibitor in RCC, a
HIF-overexpressing tumor type, would be beneficial, so we will not pursue
HIF as a target going forward. We will continue to focus on the potent
topoisomerase 1 inhibition of CRLX101's payload, camptothecin, in
topoisomerase 1-sensitive tumors. Our combinations with weekly paclitaxel
and LYNPARZA(TM) (olaparib) are examples of ongoing trials that leverage
CRLX101's topoisomerase 1 inhibition in combination with chemotherapies and
DNA damage repair agents.""

  About CRLX101
  CRLX101 is a nanoparticle-drug conjugate (NDC) designed to concentrate in
tumors and slowly release its anti-cancer payload, camptothecin, inside
tumor cells. CRLX101 inhibits topoisomerase 1 (topo 1), which is involved in
cellular replication. CRLX101 has shown activity in multiple tumor types,
both as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer treatments. CRLX101
is in Phase 2 clinical development and has been dosed in more than 400
patients. The U.S. FDA has granted CRLX101 Orphan Drug designation for the
treatment of ovarian cancer, Fast Track designation in combination with
paclitaxel for platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma, fallopian tube or
primary peritoneal cancer, and Fast Track designation in combination with
Avastin(R) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
  About Cerulean Pharma
  The Cerulean team is committed to improving treatment for people living with
cancer. We apply our Dynamic Tumor Targeting(TM) Platform to create a
portfolio of NDCs designed to selectively attack tumor cells, reduce
toxicity by sparing the body's normal cells, and enable therapeutic
combinations. Our first platform-generated NDC clinical candidate, CRLX101,
is in multiple clinical trials in combination with other cancer treatments,
all of which aim to unlock the power of combination therapy. Our second
platform-generated NDC clinical candidate, CRLX301, is in Phase 2a clinical
development. For more information, please visit www.ceruleanrx.com.
  About Cerulean's Dynamic Tumor Targeting(TM) Platform
  Cerulean's Dynamic Tumor Targeting Platform creates NDCs that are designed
to provide safer and more effective cancer treatments. We believe our NDCs
concentrate their anti-cancer payloads inside tumors while sparing normal
tissue because they are small enough to pass through the ""leaky"" vasculature
present in tumors but are too large to pass through the wall of healthy
blood vessels. Once inside tumors, our NDCs enter tumor cells where they
slowly release anti-cancer payloads from within the tumor cells.
","Cerulean Announces Results from Phase 2 Clinical Trial of CRLX101 and Avastin(R) Combination in Relapsed Renal Cell Carcinoma   CRLX101 plus Avastin Does Not Show Improvement Compared to Standard of Care in this Setting   Company to Host Conference Call Today at 4:30 pm EDT WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 17, 2016--   Cerulean Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ:CERU), a clinical-stage company developing nanoparticle-drug conjugates (NDCs), today announced top-line results from the Company's Phase 2, randomized, multi-center clinical trial of its lead candidate, CRLX101, in combination with Avastin(R) (bevacizumab) in the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).   The trial was conducted at 43 sites in the US and South Korea, and enrolled 115 patients with RCC who progressed through two or three prior lines of therapy. Patients were randomized to receive CRLX101 in combination with Avastin or investigator's choice standard of care (SOC) therapy. SOC agents included axitinib, bevacizumab, everolimus, pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, and temsirolimus. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) in the clear cell population (n=102) assessed by independent radiological review. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival.   The study demonstrated no statistically significant difference in median PFS and objective response rate for the CRLX101 combination compared to SOC. Median PFS was 3.7 months for the CRLX101 combination compared with a median PFS of 3.9 months for SOC (hazard ratio: 1.25, p=0.822). The 95% confidence interval for PFS for the CRLX101 combination was 2.0 months to 4.3 months and for SOC was 2.2 months to 5.4 months. Objective response rate by independent radiological review for patients who received the CRLX101 combination was 5% (2/42) compared to 14% (6/43) for SOC (p=0.836). The CRLX101 and Avastin combination appeared to be safe and well-tolerated and the safety and tolerability profile of the combination was consistent with that observed in previous studies. The full data set from the trial are expected to be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical conference.    ""We are disappointed with this outcome and will undertake a thorough analysis of the data to understand why CRLX101 plus Avastin underperformed compared to the results we saw in an earlier investigator-sponsored trial,"" said Christopher D. T. Guiffre, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cerulean. ""This outcome did not support our hypothesis that targeting hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) in combination with VEGF inhibitor in RCC, a HIF-overexpressing tumor type, would be beneficial, so we will not pursue HIF as a target going forward. We will continue to focus on the potent topoisomerase 1 inhibition of CRLX101's payload, camptothecin, in topoisomerase 1-sensitive tumors. Our combinations with weekly paclitaxel and LYNPARZA(TM) (olaparib) are examples of ongoing trials that leverage CRLX101's topoisomerase 1 inhibition in combination with chemotherapies and DNA damage repair agents.""   Conference Call Details   Cerulean will host a conference call today at 4:30 pm Eastern Daylight Time to discuss the results and provide an update on the CRLX101 development program.

   -- Crenezumab higher dose in CREAD Phase 3 Alzheimer's trial supported by
      exposure-response model

   -- Phase 1b dose-escalation study results support 60mg/kg dose in CREAD
      Phase 3
  Lausanne, Switzerland, December 9, 2016 - AC Immune SA (NASDAQ: ACIU), a
Swiss-based, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on
neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that its partner Genentech,
member of Roche group, has presented important data to support the unique
binding and increased dosing of its Alzheimer's therapy on crenezumab, an
anti-Abeta antibody. These data were presented at the 9(th) Clinical Trials
on Alzheimer's disease Conference (CTAD) in San Diego, USA: they were from a
Phase 1b safety study and an exposure-response model to evaluate the best
dose of crenezumab for the treatment of people with Alzheimer's disease. The
model predicts, relative to the Phase 2 trials, an improved outcome of the
CREAD Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with prodromal-to-mild Alzheimer by
using the higher dose of 60mg/kg of crenezumab.
  Prof. Andrea Pfeifer, CEO of AC Immune, commented: ""We are impressed by the
drug-disease model, as well as the safety data of the Phase 1b study which
further support the higher dose of crenezumab in the Phase III trial
targeting prodromal-to-mild Alzheimer patients.""
  About the crenezumab drug-disease progression model
  Genentech has developed a comprehensive drug-disease progression model to
simulate the Phase 3 clinical trial and estimate the likelihood of achieving
relative reduction in disease progression in patients treated with different
doses of crenezumab, in different patient populations. The drug-disease
model adequately described the historical longitudinal decline in ADAS-Cog
12([1]) and CDR-SB([2]) in mild to moderate AD patients of crenezumab in
Phase 2 studies (ABBY/BLAZE).
  The clinical trial simulations using the drug-disease model predict a
meaningful response of crenezumab in patients with mild AD at a dose of
60mg/kg IV every 4 weeks, as measured by CDR-SB and ADAS-Cog 12. This dose
of 60mg/kg IV was selected by Genentech for the Phase 3 CREAD trial, which
started recruitment of patients in Q1 2016.
  About the Phase 1b study results
  Genentech presented the results of the first two cohorts of the Phase 1b
crenezumab dose escalation study (NCT02353598) in 52 patients with
mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. No dose-limiting toxicities were
observed at 30, 45 and 60mg/kg doses of crenezumab. No events of Amyloid
Related Imaging Abnormality-Edema (ARIA-E) were observed in the Phase 1b
study and only a few patients (6 of 52) showed asymptomatic Amyloid Related
Imaging Abnormality-Hemsiderin(ARIA-H) which did not result in treatment
discontinuation. The pharmacokinetic profile of crenezumab is dose
proportional up to the 60mg/kg dose and is consistent with historical data.
The serum concentrations at this dose are four fold higher than in the
15mg/kg IV every four weeks dose used in the Phase 2 trials. These safety
and pharmacokinetic data of the Phase 1b dose escalation study support the
continued treatment of patients with crenezumab at a higher dose of 60mg/kg.

  About Crenezumab
  Crenezumab was discovered by AC Immune using its SupraAntigen technology
platform and out-licensed to Genentech in 2006 as a potential therapy for
Alzheimer's disease.  Crenezumab is a fully humanized IgG4 monoclonal
antibody that binds all forms of misfolded Abeta proteins, but especially to
Abeta oligomers, to prevent and break up Abeta aggregation and promote Abeta
disaggregation. The IgG4 subclass has reduced the effector function,
allowing microglia to clear Abeta from the brain while minimizing an
inflammatory response.
  Genentech is currently evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of
crenezumab in a Phase 3 clinical trial, CREAD, in 750 participants with
prodromal or mild Alzheimer's disease, which started in Q1 2016 and is
expected to read out in 2020. In addition crenezumab was chosen by an
international panel of experts, including the US National Institutes of
Health, for use in a first-ever prevention trial in Alzheimer's disease in a
large extended family in Colombia (API ADAD) in 2012.
  About Alzheimer's disease
  It is becoming increasingly clear that Alzheimer's disease develops because
of a complex series of events that take place in the brain over a long
period of time. Two proteins - Tau and beta-amyloid (Abeta) - are recognized
as major hallmarks of neurodegeneration: tangles and other abnormal forms of
Tau protein accumulate inside the brain cells and spread between cells,
while plaques and oligomers formed by beta-amyloid occur outside the brain
cells of people with AD.
  AD is one of the biggest burdens of society with a dramatic and growing
worldwide incidence rate of one new case every three seconds, or 9.9 million
new cases of dementia each year. Since the incidence and prevalence of AD
increase with age, the number of patients will grow significantly as society
ages. Worldwide in 2015 there are 46.8 million people living with dementia
and by 2050 it is expected that global patient numbers will triple to 131.5
million. It is estimated that the annual societal and economic cost of
dementia has risen from US$ 604 billion in 2010 to US$ 818 billion in 2015.
In the US, AD is now the 6th leading cause of death across all ages and is
the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older.

(NASDAQ:SGYP) today announced positive top-line results from the first of two pivotal phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of plecanatide, an investigational once-daily orally-administered compound, in 1,135 adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).

Preliminary analysis of the data indicates that both plecanatide 3 mg and 6 mg doses met the study’s primary endpoint and showed statistical significance in the percentage of patients who were Overall Responders compared to placebo during the 12-week treatment period (21.5% in 3 mg and 24.0% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 14.2% in placebo; p=0.009 for 3 mg and p<0.001 for 6 mg). An Overall Responder, as defined by the FDA, is a patient who fulfills both ≥ 30% reduction in worst abdominal pain and an increase of ≥ 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) from baseline, in the same week, for at least 50% of the 12 treatment weeks.

The most common adverse event was diarrhea which occurred in 3.2% of patients in 3 mg and 3.7% of patients in 6 mg dose groups compared to 1.3% of placebo-treated patients.

“We are very pleased with these results,” said Gary S. Jacob, Ph.D., Chairman and CEO of Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. “These data reinforce our strong belief that plecanatide may represent an important new treatment option for the millions of patients currently suffering from IBS-C. We look forward to the results of our second phase 3 IBS-C trial with plecanatide later this month.”

Four patients in the trial (0.4%) experienced serious adverse events but there was no imbalance across treatment groups in either incidences or individual serious adverse events. Overall, the rates of withdrawal from treatment because of an adverse event were low (1.9% in 3 mg and 1.8% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 0 in placebo) and discontinuations due to diarrhea were infrequent (0.8% in 3 mg and 1.6% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 0 in placebo).

Additionally, plecanatide is under review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is January 29, 2017. Pending approval in the CIC indication, the company plans to file a New Drug Application Supplement with Clinical Data (sNDA) for plecanatide in IBS-C in Q1 2017.

The Plecanatide Phase 3 IBS-C Program

Design

The plecanatide phase 3 IBS-C program includes two randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of plecanatide treatment (3 mg and 6 mg doses), taken as a tablet once-a-day in patients with IBS-C. Both trials included a two-week pre-treatment baseline period, a 12-week treatment period, and a two-week post-treatment follow-up period. The phase 3 IBS-C program was designed to support regulatory submission in the U.S.

The first phase 3 IBS-C trial was conducted in North America and assessed 1,135 patients (28.2% males and 71.8% females) that were randomly assigned to take 3 mg or 6 mg plecanatide or placebo once-a-day during the 12-week treatment period (377 patients in the 3 mg dose group, 379 patients in the 6 mg dose group and 379 patients in the placebo group).

Primary Endpoint

The primary endpoint for both trials is the percentage of patients who are Overall Responders (%) during the 12-week treatment period. An Overall Responder, as defined by the FDA, is a patient who fulfills both ≥ 30% reduction in worst abdominal pain and an increase of ≥ 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) from baseline, in the same week, for at least 50% of the 12 treatment weeks. The Overall Responder endpoint is the current regulatory endpoint required for U.S. approval in IBS-C.

Patient Population

Patients were selected using Rome 3 criteria for IBS-C. Patients with IBS-C are defined by Rome III Criteria as having a history of constipation and abdominal pain for at least 6 months, including hard or lumpy stools for 25% or more of defecations, loose or watery stools for 25% or less of defecations, and abdominal pain or discomfort for 3 days or more per month for the last 3 months.

About Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C)

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, complex condition subtyped by the predominant stool form: constipation (IBS-C), diarrhea (IBS-D), or mixed (IBS-M). It is estimated that the prevalence of IBS-C in the U.S. adult population is approximately 4 to 5 percent, though this number may vary as patients often fluctuate between the three subtypes of IBS. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with two or more of the following: improvement with defecation, onset associated with a change in frequency of stool, or onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool.

About Plecanatide

Plecanatide is a peptide made up of 16 amino acids and, with the exception of a single amino acid substitution, it is identical to uroguanylin. Plecanatide is the first investigational drug designed to replicate the function of uroguanylin, a naturally occurring and endogenous human GI peptide which acts in a pH-sensitive manner targeting GC-C receptors primarily in the proximal small intestine. Plecanatide stimulates fluid secretion and promotes stool consistency necessary to support normal bowel function.","Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.

The phase 3 IBS-C program was designed to support regulatory submission in the U.S.  The first phase 3 IBS-C trial was conducted in North America and assessed 1,135 patients (28.2% males and 71.8% females) that were randomly assigned to take 3 mg or 6 mg plecanatide or placebo once-a-day during the 12-week treatment period (377 patients in the 3 mg dose group, 379 patients in the 6 mg dose group and 379 patients in the placebo group).  Primary Endpoint  The primary endpoint for both trials is the percentage of patients who are Overall Responders (%) during the 12-week treatment period. An Overall Responder, as defined by the FDA, is a patient who fulfills both ≥ 30% reduction in worst abdominal pain and an increase of ≥ 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) from baseline, in the same week, for at least 50% of the 12 treatment weeks. The Overall Responder endpoint is the current regulatory endpoint required for U.S. approval in IBS-C.  Patient Population  Patients were selected using Rome 3 criteria for IBS-C. Patients with IBS-C are defined by Rome III Criteria as having a history of constipation and abdominal pain for at least 6 months, including hard or lumpy stools for 25% or more of defecations, loose or watery stools for 25% or less of defecations, and abdominal pain or discomfort for 3 days or more per month for the last 3 months.  About Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C)  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, complex condition subtyped by the predominant stool form: constipation (IBS-C), diarrhea (IBS-D), or mixed (IBS-M). It is estimated that the prevalence of IBS-C in the U.S. adult population is approximately 4 to 5 percent, though this number may vary as patients often fluctuate between the three subtypes of IBS. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with two or more of the following: improvement with defecation, onset associated with a change in frequency of stool, or onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool.  About Plecanatide  Plecanatide is a peptide made up of 16 amino acids and, with the exception of a single amino acid substitution, it is identical to uroguanylin. Plecanatide is the first investigational drug designed to replicate the function of uroguanylin, a naturally occurring and endogenous human GI peptide which acts in a pH-sensitive manner targeting GC-C receptors primarily in the proximal small intestine. Plecanatide stimulates fluid secretion and promotes stool consistency necessary to support normal bowel function.",,20%

  Reports Positive Data on Primary Endpoint with Positive Safety Data
  Overall Survival Compares Favorably with Single-Agent Nivolumab
  Management to host a call on Thursday, December 8(th) , at 8:30 a.m. ET
  DURHAM, N.C., Dec. 06, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heat Biologics, Inc.
(Nasdaq:HTBX), a leader in the development of gp96-based immunotherapies
designed to activate a patient's immune system to fight cancer, reported
topline response and survival results in the ongoing Phase 1b study
evaluating HS-110, in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's anti-PD-1
checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab (Opdivo(R)), for the treatment of non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), at the International Association for the Study of
Lung Cancer Annual Meeting in Vienna, Austria.
  In an oral presentation, principal investigator, Daniel Morgensztern, MD,
Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of Thoracic Oncology,
Washington University School of Medicine, reported that one-year results
from the first eight trial patients showed that the HS-110/nivolumab
combination was well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with single
agent nivolumab. There were no additional toxicities seen in
HS-110/nivolumab combination compared to existing data on single agent
nivolumab alone. HS-110 generated a robust antigen-specific immune response
in several patients, consistent with the mechanism of action seen in other
HS-110 trials.  Additionally, the patients who responded best to the
combination therapy (immune responders) had longer overall survival and
better objective response rate (ORR) than the non-immune responders, even
though they had the same baseline immune function.
  Immune responders in the study saw a 50% ORR, while non-immune responders
saw a 0% ORR. This is important, as checkpoint inhibitors have been shown,
independently, to be much more effective in tumors with pre-existing, high
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). As such, there now exists an acute
need to address the large proportion of non-responders with low-TIL tumors.
  Moreover, the immune responders had a better median overall survival (OS)
than non-immune responders. The one-year OS is currently 50% for the
responders, and 25% for the non-responders. Finally, immune responders also
saw a better median OS at 12.7 months, than non-immune responders, who saw a
median OS of 7.1 months.  Researchers concluded that immune response may
correlate with clinical efficacy and that HS-110 may have synergistic
activity with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
  ""We are encouraged by the data generated in the trial,"" said Dr.
Morgensztern. ""We were impressed by the ability of HS-110 to activate a CD8+
T cell immune response. The HS-110/nivolumab combination is worth continued
exploration in the treatment of lung cancer, as the HS-110 mechanism of
action is potentially synergistic with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors.""
  ""We've continued to see ELISPOT analysis correlate with clinical efficacy
with HS-110 in NSCLC, an encouraging trend also observed in other trials
with HS-110,"" said Taylor Schreiber, MD, PhD, Heat's Chief Scientific
Officer. ""We are seeing trends between TIL status and TIL increases after
treatment among these patients, which may speak to the ability of HS-110 to
convert ""cold"" tumors to ""hot"" tumors to increase the effectiveness of PD-1
checkpoint therapy in lung cancer.""
  ""These new data are further confirmation of the ability of our ImPACT
platform, which has been administered to over 200 patients in 4 clinical
studies, to generate a robust antigen-specific immune response, an important
component of immunotherapy,"" said Jeff Wolf, Heat's CEO.  ""The future of
immuno-oncology lies in combining synergistic modalities to create more
effective treatments. At Heat, we are actively pursuing opportunities to
combine our ImPACT and ComPACT platforms with checkpoint inhibitors, and
other promising immunotherapies to improve patient outcomes.""

Study in Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Patients
  Data presentation at CTAD 2016
  NEW YORK, Dec. 08, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Anavex Life Sciences Corp.
(""Anavex"" or the ""Company"") (Nasdaq:AVXL) today announced a positive 57-week
update from its Phase 2a study in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD)
patients for ANAVEX 2-73, which targets cellular homeostasis. The study met
both primary and secondary endpoints.
  At 57 weeks, Alzheimer's patients taking a daily oral dose between 10mg and
50mg, ANAVEX 2-73 was well tolerated. There were no clinically significant
treatment-related adverse events and no serious adverse events.
  Published AD studies confirmed substantial declines of cognitive (MMSE) and
functional (ADCS-ADL) measures as well as Cogstate and EEG/ERP over 12 month
in similar AD populations. Pre-specified exploratory analyses of the current
study included the cognitive (MMSE) and the functional (ADCS-ADL) as well as
Cogstate, HAM-D and EEG/ERP changes from baseline.
  Specifically, in comparison to historical control from a pooled placebo arm
cohort study conducted by the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Group in
mild-to-moderate AD patients of comparable ages and MMSE baselines, over 12
month the ANAVEX 2-73 data shows a calculated treatment benefit of 1.8
points on the MMSE scale (p<0.016) and a calculated treatment benefit of 4
points on the ADCS-ADL score (p<0.019). Furthermore, the correlation was
positive with all measured scores (MMSE, ADCS-ADL, Cogstate, HAM-D and
EEG/ERP).
  George Perry, PhD, Dean and Professor at the University of Texas at San
Antonio and Editor-in Chief of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,
commented, ""In addition to the very encouraging results, which point to the
therapeutic potential of targeting cellular homeostasis in a complex CNS
disease like Alzheimer's, this trial has been intelligently designed as a
highly informative study, looking unprejudiced at all potential
relationships and hence allowing to learn from all correlations of the now
available pool of data, in order to execute subsequent trials with much more
relevant information at hand.""
  Despite non-optimized dosing of ANAVEX 2-73 throughout the 12-month study,
continued significant improvements from baseline of cognitive, functional
and behavioral scores in a group of patients were observed, respectively.
This data will be analyzed using refined mathematical modeling methods in
conjunction with the detailed pharmacokinetic (PK) information.
  ""Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes
problems with memory, thinking and behavior. Currently available treatments
cannot stop Alzheimer's from progressing; they can only temporarily slow the
worsening of dementia symptoms,"" said Christopher U. Missling, PhD,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Anavex. ""We believe this data gives
us a solid foundation from which to continue the next phase of rationally
designed clinical trials. Anavex is grateful for the dedication of the
patients, their families and the clinical investigators who participated in
this study.""
  The Company is presenting findings from the study at the Clinical Trials on
Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) meeting on Saturday, December 10th at 8:45 a.m.
PT in the oral communication session. The presentation will be available in
the publications section of the Anavex website.
  The Company will also conduct a conference call with the investment
community in conjunction with the upcoming financial year-end 2016 report.
  About the ANAVEX 2-73 Phase 2a Study
  The multicenter Phase 2a clinical trial of ANAVEX 2-73 consists of two parts
and a total of 32 mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's patients. PART A is a simple
randomized, open-label, two-period, cross-over between oral (30mg/50mg) and
IV (3mg/5mg) administration, adaptive trial lasting up to 5 weeks for each
patient. PART B is an open-label extension for an additional 52 weeks.
Initially planned for 26 weeks, PART B was extended to 52 weeks as a result
of requests from patients and caregivers.
  The primary endpoint of the Phase 2a trial is to establish safety,
tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ANAVEX 2-73, which had
shown potential in preclinical studies to prevent, halt and/or reverse the
course of the disease. Secondary endpoints include dose response,
bioavailability, and exploratory cognitive as well as functional measures
using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and evaluation of Alzheimer's
Disease Co-operative Study -- Activities of Daily Living Inventory
(ADCS-ADL), as well as Cogstate test battery and EEG/ERP.
  Additional information regarding the ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial is
available from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trials
database at www.clinicaltrials.gov.

  CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 07, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Voyager Therapeutics,
Inc. (NASDAQ:VYGR), a clinical-stage gene therapy company developing
life-changing treatments for severe diseases of the central nervous system
(CNS), today announced positive results from the ongoing Phase 1b trial of
VY-AADC01 at six and twelve months of follow-up in patients with advanced
Parkinson's disease.  The interim data from Cohorts 1 and 2 of this trial
demonstrated that accurate MRI-guided delivery of escalating doses of
VY-AADC01 were well tolerated and resulted in increased coverage of the
putamen, increased AADC enzyme activity, enhanced response to levodopa, and
dose-related, clinically meaningful improvements in various measures of
patients' motor function.  This was especially evident at the higher dose in
Cohort 2 with improved UPDRS off medication and on medication scores, and
corresponding improvements in patient-reported diary hours, suggesting
higher peak effects and a longer duration of action of levodopa.  These
effects were maintained and in some patients improved at 12 months of
follow-up.
  ""At 12 months in Cohort 2, treatment with VY-AADC01 resulted in a 14-point,
or 44%, improvement in UPDRS-III off medication, a 9-point, or 55%
improvement in UPDRS-III on medication, and a 2.2 hour, or 48%, decrease in
diary off-time from baseline,"" said Bernard Ravina, M.D., M.S., vice
president of clinical development at Voyager Therapeutics. ""Very
importantly, these improvements in motor function occurred with a
substantial 34% reduction in daily doses of oral levodopa and related
medications at six months in Cohort 2 that was maintained at 12 months, a
magnitude that we find compelling and consistent with the mechanism of
action of VY-AADC01.  The dose-escalating portion of this trial continues
and we plan to complete Cohort 3 enrollment in early 2017, report 6-month
data from this Cohort as well as longer-term data from Cohorts 1 and 2 in
mid-2017, and present results from this trial at a medical conference in the
first half of next year.""
  About the Phase 1b Trial
  In advanced Parkinson's disease, the putamen is depleted of dopamine and of
the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) that is responsible
for converting levodopa to dopamine.  VY-AADC01 is Voyager's gene therapy
vector that contains the gene that encodes the AADC enzyme. The Phase 1b,
open-label trial includes up to 20 patients with advanced Parkinson's
disease and disabling motor fluctuations, treated with a single
administration of VY-AADC01.  The primary objective of the trial is to
assess the safety and surgical coverage of ascending doses of VY-AADC01 in
the putamen, a region of the brain associated with motor function in
Parkinson's disease.  The secondary objectives of the trial include the
assessment of AADC expression and activity in the putamen measured by
positron emission tomography (PET) using [(18) F] fluorodopa (or (18)
F-DOPA).  In addition, changes in motor responses to levodopa are measured
by a controlled intravenous infusion of levodopa and by measuring daily
requirements for levodopa and related medications. Other secondary
objectives include assessment of motor function as measured by the Unified
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and a patient-completed (Hauser)
diary.
  The UPDRS is a standard clinical rating scale for Parkinson's disease. Part
III of this scale measures motor function by physician examination. The
UPDRS is conducted when patients are taking their Parkinson's disease
medications (referred to as ""on"" medication) and when patients are not
taking their Parkinson's disease medications (referred to as ""off""
medication).  In the patient-completed diary, patients record their motor
response over the course of several days as on-time, or time when they have
good mobility with or without non-troublesome dyskinesia, off-time when they
have poor mobility, and on-time with troublesome dyskinesia when they have
uncontrolled movements.
  Biomarker and Clinical Results Summary
  Today's interim results include data from all 10 patients treated in Cohorts
1 and 2 at six months (five patients in each Cohort), and where indicated,
data from five patients in Cohort 1 and three patients in Cohort 2 who have
reached 12 months of follow-up.  Patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 received a
single administration of VY-AADC01 at a total dose of up to 7.5&#215;10(11)
vector genomes (vg) and 1.5&#215;10(12) vg, respectively.  Patients enrolled
in Cohorts 1 and 2 were on average 58 years of age with a Parkinson's
disease diagnosis for an average of 10 years.  Patients were candidates for
surgical intervention due to disabling motor complications despite treatment
with optimal anti-Parkinsonian medication.  At baseline, the average UPDRS
III off medication score was 37.2 and 35.8, and the average patient diary
off-time was 4.9 and 4.2 hours, for Cohort 1 and 2, respectively. Patients'
average amount of Parkinson's disease medications at baseline was 1,468 mg
per day for Cohort 1 and 1,636 mg per day for Cohort 2. The results below
are reported as mean changes from baseline to six months, or 12 months where
indicated.
  Putamen Coverage and Biomarker Data
   -- The use of real-time, intra-operative MRI-guided delivery and increasing

      infusion volumes resulted in 21% coverage of the volume of the putamen
      with VY-AADC01 in Cohort 1 and 34% coverage in Cohort 2.

   -- VY-AADC01 treatment resulted in a 13% increase in putaminal AADC enzyme
      activity in Cohort 1 and a 56% increase in putaminal AADC enzyme
activity
      in Cohort 2 at six months relative to baseline as measured by 18F-DOPA
      PET scans.

   -- Patients reduced their daily oral dose of levodopa and related
      medications by 14% in Cohort 1 and 34% in Cohort 2 at six months.  This
      reduction in oral medication was generally maintained at twelve months.

   -- VY-AADC01 treatment prolonged the duration and markedly increased the
      motor symptom response to levodopa measured following a controlled
      intravenous infusion of levodopa administered six months after surgery
      when compared to baseline.
  Clinical Data Summary
  Treatment with VY-AADC01 resulted in the following:
   -- 15.6-point and 17.8-point (42% and 50%) improvement (reduction) in
      UPDRS-III off medication at six months in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2,
      respectively.  These improvements were 16.4-point and 14.3-point (44%
and
      44%) for Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, at 12 months.

   -- 9.6-point (56%) improvement (reduction) in UPDRS-III on medication in
      Cohort 2 at six months that was sustained at 12 months.  Cohort 1
      demonstrated a 1.6-point (21%) worsening (increase) at six months that
      was sustained at 12 months.

   -- 2.2 hours (20%) increase in diary on-time (with no dyskinesias or
      non-troublesome dyskinesias) in Cohort 2 at six months that further
      increased to 4.1 hours (43%) at 12 months.  Cohort 1 showed a slight
      decrease in on-time at six months of 0.3 hours (-3%) and an increase of
      1.6 hours (16%) at 12 months.

   -- 1.1 hour (27%) decrease in diary off-time in Cohort 2 at six months that

      further decreased to 2.2 hours (48%) at 12 months.  Decreases in diary
      off-time in Cohort 2 also occurred in conjunction with a reduction in
      troublesome dyskinesias.  Cohort 1 showed a decrease in diary off-time
of
      0.8 hours (16%) at six months and 1.4 hours (27%) at 12 months.
  Safety Data from Cohorts 1 and 2
  The surgical procedure was successfully completed in all 10 patients and
infusions of VY-AADC01 have been well-tolerated with no vector-related
serious adverse events (SAEs).  Nine of the 10 patients were discharged from
the hospital within one to two days following surgery.  As previously
reported, one patient experienced two SAEs; a pulmonary embolism or blood
clot in the lungs, and related heart arrhythmia or irregular heartbeat.  The
patient was treated with an anti-coagulant and symptoms associated with the
SAEs have completely resolved. Investigators determined that this was most
likely related to immobility during the surgical procedure and subsequent
formation of a blood clot, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), in the lower
extremity.  Consequently, DVT prophylaxis was added to the surgical protocol
and no subsequent events have been observed following implementation of
these measures.
  ""Our surgical experience with VY-AADC01 and the results to date show that
MRI-guided infusions are well tolerated and substantially improve our
ability to tailor the infusions to fit the patients' anatomy and accurately
deliver vector to the putamen,"" said Paul Larson, M.D., Professor and Vice
Chair of Clinical Neurological Surgery, University of California San
Francisco, and investigator in the trial.  ""The increased surgical coverage
of the putamen is further validated by the PET data and is translating into
motor function improvement in patients with advanced stages of the disease.""

  Todd Sherer, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, The Michael J. Fox Foundation
for Parkinson's Research added, ""Levodopa has been the gold-standard
treatment for Parkinson's for decades, but it has limitations.  Enhancing a
patient's response to this therapy represents an important development for
those who suffer from the advanced stages of this disease, and we are glad
to see the continued progress of this program.""  The Michael J. Fox
Foundation funded part of the initial pioneering research for this program

  PR Newswire
  EDISON, N.J., Dec. 8, 2016
  EDISON, N.J., Dec. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- ContraVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(NASDAQ: CTRV), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies, today provided new
insights into the mechanism of action of its hepatitis B (HBV)-optimized
cyclophilin inhibitor CRV431, showing that it effectively blocks a critical
interaction between HBV X protein (HBx) and host cyclophilin A, with
nanomolar potency.  CRV431 is believed to be the first antiviral drug with
the potential to selectively block the HBx pathway, which is known to play
several significant roles in HBV infection including protecting infected
liver cells from immune destruction, and promoting the development of liver
cancer.
  HBx is a multifunctional viral protein known to be essential for HBV
replication and for the maintenance and progression of chronic HBV disease.
HBx is involved in the production and secretion of key viral proteins, such
as HBsAg and HBeAg. HBx further disables host factors that restrict the
production of HBV and other viral products, including covalently closed
circular DNA (cccDNA) which is key to the persistence of chronic HBV
infection. ContraVir's recent in vitro studies indicate that CRV431 blocks
the interaction between HBx and cyclophilin A, which is required for HBx to
function fully.
  Importantly, HBx is required early in the viral life cycle and works
""upstream"" of other classes of anti-HBV drugs.  CRV431 therefore could
potentially interrupt several essential pathways enabling development of a
curative combination with other HBV treatments.  CRV431 has demonstrated
synergistic activity in vitro with ContraVir's tenofovir prodrug CMX157,
currently in Phase 2 clinical trials.
  ""Identifying this exciting mechanism of action for CRV431 places ContraVir
at the very forefront of HBV research, with a compound that can effectively
target the HBx pathway,"" said James Sapirstein, CEO of ContraVir.  ""Further
development of this novel compound, and ultimately layering it on top of
CMX157 and potentially other HBV drugs, dovetails with our overall
development strategy which is focused on finding a functional cure for HBV.
The pathogenic effects of HBx are many, and we would therefore expect the
anti-HBx activity of CRV431 to be equally robust.  We will continue to work
on characterizing the activity of CRV431 and its impact on HBx and HBV
within our company, and through our peers in North America and Europe.""
  Philippe Gallay, Ph.D., Professor at The Scripps Research Institute, who
conducted the in vitro study, commented, ""HBx and its involvement in the
pathogenesis of HBV is widely supported by the scientific literature, and
its importance as a high-value drug target was highlighted at the recent
joint HBV conference hosted by the American Association of the Study of
Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the
Liver (EASL).  However, until now, we hadn't confirmed the ability of an
antiviral drug to bind to a specific ligand of HBx -- cyclophilin A.  CRV431
may therefore be unique as a small molecule drug that selectively targets
the function of HBx and thus has the potential to repress, among other
things, cccDNA transcription, which has exciting implications about its
potential to significantly inhibit HBV when used together with complementary
antivirals.  We are proud to lead this cutting edge research by continuing
to advance CRV431.""
  About ContraVir Pharmaceuticals
  ContraVir is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies with a specific focus on
developing a potentially curative therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV). The
Company is developing two novel anti-HBV compounds with complementary
mechanisms of action: CMX157, a highly potent analog of the successful
antiviral drug tenofovir currently in Phase 2a, which has demonstrated the
potential for low, once a day dosing compared to Viread(R) and decreased
systemic exposure, thereby potentially reducing renal and bone side effects;
and CRV431, a next generation cyclophilin inhibitor with a unique structure
that increases its potency and selective index against HBV. ContraVir is
also developing Valnivudine (TM) (formerly FV-100), an orally available
nucleoside analogue prodrug for the treatment of herpes zoster, or shingles,
in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In addition to direct antiviral activity,
Valnivudine(TM) has demonstrated the potential to reduce the incidence of
debilitating shingles-associated pain known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN)
in a Phase 2 clinical study. For more information visit www.contravir.com.

""Further development of this novel compound, and ultimately layering it on top of CMX157 and potentially other HBV drugs, dovetails with our overall development strategy which is focused on finding a functional cure for HBV. The pathogenic effects of HBx are many, and we would therefore expect the anti-HBx activity of CRV431 to be equally robust.  We will continue to work on characterizing the activity of CRV431 and its impact on HBx and HBV within our company, and through our peers in North America and Europe.""   Philippe Gallay, Ph.D., Professor at The Scripps Research Institute, who conducted the in vitro study, commented, ""HBx and its involvement in the pathogenesis of HBV is widely supported by the scientific literature, and its importance as a high-value drug target was highlighted at the recent joint HBV conference hosted by the American Association of the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL).  However, until now, we hadn't confirmed the ability of an antiviral drug to bind to a specific ligand of HBx -- cyclophilin A.  CRV431 may therefore be unique as a small molecule drug that selectively targets the function of HBx and thus has the potential to repress, among other things, cccDNA transcription, which has exciting implications about its potential to significantly inhibit HBV when used together with complementary antivirals.  We are proud to lead this cutting edge research by continuing to advance CRV431.""   About ContraVir Pharmaceuticals   ContraVir is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies with a specific focus on developing a potentially curative therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV). The Company is developing two novel anti-HBV compounds with complementary mechanisms of action: CMX157, a highly potent analog of the successful antiviral drug tenofovir currently in Phase 2a, which has demonstrated the potential for low, once a day dosing compared to Viread(R) and decreased systemic exposure, thereby potentially reducing renal and bone side effects; and CRV431, a next generation cyclophilin inhibitor with a unique structure that increases its potency and selective index against HBV. ContraVir is also developing Valnivudine (TM) (formerly FV-100), an orally available nucleoside analogue prodrug for the treatment of herpes zoster, or shingles, in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In addition to direct antiviral activity, Valnivudine(TM) has demonstrated the potential to reduce the incidence of debilitating shingles-associated pain known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in a Phase 2 clinical study.

ACTIMMUNE(R) (interferon gamma-1b) in Friedreich's Ataxia
  Conference call today at 8 a.m. ET
  DUBLIN, Ireland, Dec. 08, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Horizon Pharma plc
(NASDAQ:HZNP), a biopharmaceutical company focused on improving patients'
lives by identifying, developing, acquiring and commercializing
differentiated and accessible medicines that address unmet medical needs,
today announced that the Phase 3 trial, STEADFAST (Safety, Tolerability and
Efficacy of ACTIMMUNE Dose Escalation in Friedreich's Ataxia study),
evaluating ACTIMMUNE(R) (interferon gamma-1b) for the treatment of
Friedreich's ataxia (FA) did not meet its primary endpoint of a
statistically significant change from baseline in the modified Friedreich's
Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS--mNeuro) at 26 weeks versus treatment with
placebo.  FARS--mNeuro is an exam-based rating scale that measures disease
progression based on functional parameters such as speech, ability to
swallow, upper and lower limb coordination, gait and posture.
  In addition, the secondary endpoints did not meet statistical significance.
No new safety findings were identified on initial review of data other than
those already noted in the ACTIMMUNE prescribing information for approved
indications.  The Company, in conjunction with the independent Data Safety
Monitoring Board, the principal investigator and the Friedreich's Ataxia
Research Alliance (FARA) Collaborative Clinical Research Network (CCRN) in
FA, has determined that, based on the trial results, the FA development
program will be discontinued, including the 26-week extension study and the
long-term safety study.
  Patients participating in the ongoing extension studies should contact their
study site coordinator for further information and next steps.
  The Company will continue to work with FARA and the principal investigator
to further analyze the data to help inform future research efforts as well
as future data presentation or publication.
  ""A well-designed, rigorous study like STEADFAST would not have been possible
without the extraordinary drive of the FA community, particularly the people
who enrolled in the study, the clinical trial investigators and the
Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance,"" said Timothy P. Walbert, chairman,
president and chief executive officer, Horizon Pharma plc.  ""While the
results were not what we hoped for, this is the very reason why research and
development is important -- to find answers that may help inform future
research.""
  ""FARA's mission is to drive research to develop therapies that will treat
and cure Friedreich's ataxia and we remain passionately committed to that
mission so that one day soon patients and caregivers impacted by this
devastating disease will have effective treatment options,"" said Ronald J.
Bartek, co-founder and founding president, FARA.  ""We want to extend our
sincere appreciation to all of the patients, patient families and
investigators who were a part of this study as well as Horizon for
collaborating with us so impressively on this important research.""
  The announcement today does not impact Horizon Pharma's full-year 2016
adjusted net sales or adjusted EBITDA guidance, and the Company believes it
is well-positioned for growth in 2017 and beyond based on its existing
portfolio of medicines.  Horizon's management will host a live conference

  About STEADFAST
  Conducted by Horizon in partnership with the Friedrich's Ataxia Research
Alliance (FARA), STEADFAST or Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of ACTIMMUNE
Dose Escalation in Friedreich's Ataxia study enrolled 92 patients at four
top FA centers across the country.  The randomized, multi-center,
double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, evaluated patients treated
with subcutaneous doses of either ACTIMMUNE or placebo three times a week
for a total of 26 weeks.
  The primary endpoint evaluated the effect of ACTIMMUNE versus placebo on the
change from baseline to Week 26 in neurological outcome as measured by the
modified Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS--mNeuro), a subset of the
total FARS score that measures objective components of a patient's ability
to function such as upper and lower extremity coordination.  The FARS is a
validated neurological outcome scale, in which higher scores reflect a
greater level of disability.  FARS-mNeuro was determined by experts in the
field to be the most clinically relevant instrument for assessing the
effects of treatment on FA in this particular trial.  Secondary endpoints
included observed mean change from baseline to week 26 in Activities of
Daily Living (ADL), Timed 25-foot Walk Test (T25FW), Friedreich's Ataxia
Rating Scale (FARS) scores, and other neurologic evaluations. In addition to
safety and efficacy, the STEADFAST trial evaluated the pharmacokinetic
characteristics of ACTIMMUNE in people with FA.
  About Friedreich's ataxia (FA)
  FA is a debilitating, life-shortening and degenerative neuro-muscular
disorder that affects approximately 4,000 to 6,000 people in the United
States.  Onset of symptoms can vary from five years old to adulthood, with
the childhood onset tending to be associated with a more rapid progression.
Symptoms include progressive loss of strength and coordination usually
leading to wheelchair use; diminished vision, hearing and speech; scoliosis
(curvature of the spine); increased risk of diabetes; and a life-threatening
heart condition.  Most young people diagnosed with FA require mobility aids
such as a cane, walker or wheelchair by their teens or early 20's.  There
are currently no approved treatments for FA.
  About ACTIMMUNE
  ACTIMMUNE (interferon gamma-1b) is a biologically manufactured protein
similar to one the body makes naturally to help prevent infection. ACTIMMUNE
is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use
in two rare diseases.  It is indicated for reducing the frequency and
severity of serious infections associated with Chronic Granulomatous Disease
(CGD), a genetic disorder that affects the functioning of some cells of the
immune system.  In addition, ACTIMMUNE is indicated for delaying time to
disease progression for patients with severe, malignant osteopetrosis (SMO),
a genetic disorder that affects normal bone formation.  For more
information, please see www.ACTIMMUNE.com.
  ACTIMMUNE is not indicated for FA.
  ACTIMMUNE Important Safety Information
  ACTIMMUNE is contraindicated in patients who develop or have known
hypersensitivity to interferon-gamma, E coli-derived products or any
component of the product
  ACTIMMUNE should be used with caution in patients with:
   -- pre-existing cardiac conditions, including ischemia, congestive heart
      failure or arrhythmia

   -- Seizure disorders or compromised central nervous system function; reduce

      dose or discontinue

   -- Myelosuppression, or receiving other potentially myelosuppressive
agents;
      consider dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy

   -- Severe renal insufficiency

   -- Age < 1 year
  Monitoring:
   -- Patients begun on ACTIMMUNE before age 1 year should receive monthly
      assessments of liver function.  If severe hepatic enzyme elevations
      develop, ACTIMMUNE dosage should be modified

   -- Monitor renal function regularly when administering ACTIMMUNE in
patients
      with severe renal insufficiency; accumulation of interferon gamma-1b may

      occur with repeated administration. Renal toxicity has been reported in
      patients receiving ACTIMMUNE
  Pregnancy, Lactation, and Fertility:
   -- ACTIMMUNE should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit
      outweighs the potential risk to the fetus

   -- Use of ACTIMMUNE by lactating mothers is not recommended. ACTIMMUNE or
      nursing should be discontinued dependent on the importance of the drug
to
      the mother

   -- Long-term effects of ACTIMMUNE on fertility are not known
  Drug Interactions:
   -- Concomitant use of drugs with neurotoxic, hematotoxic or cardiotoxic
      effects may increase the toxicity of interferons

   -- Avoid simultaneous administration of ACTIMMUNE with other heterologous
      serum protein or immunological preparations (e.g., vaccines)
  Adverse Reactions:
   -- The most common adverse experiences occurring with ACTIMMUNE therapy are

      ""flu-like"" symptoms such as fever, headache, chills, myalgia or fatigue,

      which may decrease in severity as treatment continues, and may be
      minimized by bedtime administration of ACTIMMUNE

   -- Acetaminophen may be used to prevent or partially alleviate the fever
and
      headache

   -- Isolated cases of acute serious hypersensitivity reactions have been
      observed in patients receiving ACTIMMUNE

   -- Reversible neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevations of AST and/or
      ALT have been observed during ACTIMMUNE therapy

   -- At doses 10 times greater than the weekly recommended dose, ACTIMMUNE
may
      exacerbate pre-existing cardiac conditions or may cause reversible
      neurological effects such as decreased mental status, gait disturbance
      and dizziness

Figure 1. Mean Change from Baseline in Weekly Frequency of Moderate to Severe Hot Flashes for Weeks 1 to 12 (Graphic: Business Wire)

The Replenish Trial evaluated four doses of TX-001HR and placebo in 1,835 post-menopausal women between 40 and 65 years old. The doses studied were:

17ß-estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 416)
17ß-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 423)
17ß-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 421)
17ß-estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 424)
Placebo (n = 151)
The Replenish Trial results demonstrated:

TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both achieved all four of the co-primary efficacy endpoints and the primary safety endpoint.
TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in both the frequency and severity of hot flashes compared to placebo.
TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg were not statistically significant at all of the co-primary efficacy endpoints. The estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg dose was included in the clinical trial as a non-effective dose to meet the recommendation of the FDA guidance to identify the lowest effective dose.
The incidence of consensus endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy was 0 percent across all four TX-001HR doses, meeting the recommendations established by the U.S. Food and Drug Agency’s (FDA) draft guidance.1
As outlined in the FDA guidance, the co-primary efficacy endpoints in the Replenish Trial were the change from baseline in the number and severity of hot flashes at weeks 4 and 12 as compared to placebo.1 The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia with up to 12 months of treatment. General safety was also evaluated.

The results of the Replenish Trial (p-values of < 0.05 meet FDA guidance and support evidence of efficacy) are summarized in the below table and included multimedia.

“We are very pleased that multiple doses of TX-001HR studied in the Replenish Trial demonstrated these positive results, suggesting that, if approved, this drug product candidate is poised to address the significant demand for bio-identical hormone therapy,” said Chief Executive Officer Robert G. Finizio. “We have successfully advanced the science for post-menopausal women’s health by finding a way to effectively combine bio-identical estradiol and bio-identical progesterone. The need for a bio-identical FDA-approved combination therapy has been unanswered for decades, driving women to use unapproved drugs mixed together by independent and community pharmacies that compound these products. We believe that TX-001HR, if approved, will provide women, healthcare providers and pharmacists with a proven safe, effective and insurance reimbursed bio-identical combination product, finally answering that need. We will continue to evaluate these promising data, and look forward to submitting a New Drug Application for TX-001HR to the Food and Drug Administration as early as the third quarter of 2017.”

The trial also demonstrated a dose response favoring the higher doses of estradiol in combination with progesterone. The availability of multiple doses of TX-001HR would allow for individualized therapy to meet the needs of a diverse population of women.

The most common adverse events (>5 percent) reported on average in all the active treatment groups were headache, nasopharyngitis, breast tenderness, and upper respiratory infection. There was a very low reported incidence of adverse events of somnolence with TX-001HR, in contrast to commercially available oral progesterone where somnolence has been reported as a significant side effect. There were no unexpected safety signals.

The Replenish Trial evaluated various secondary endpoints using well-validated patient reported outcome tools, including the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL), the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI), and the responder analysis rate. Both TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in the secondary endpoints using these tools.

Additional efficacy and safety analyses of the Replenish Trial data are ongoing and TherapeuticsMD plans to submit the full Replenish Trial results for presentation at future scientific meetings and for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

“TX-001HR is the first bio-identical combination hormone therapy of estradiol in combination with progesterone to be evaluated in a large, well-controlled, randomized clinical trial,” said TherapeuticsMD Chief Medical Officer Sebastian Mirkin, M.D. “The Replenish Trial demonstrated for the first-time safety and robust efficacy for the treatment of hot flashes at multiple doses of TX-001HR. If approved, TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg would provide TherapeuticsMD with a complete portfolio to meet the demands of women currently taking unapproved compounded hormones for the treatment of VMS, along with the healthcare providers and pharmacies that prescribe and compound these products.”

About TX-001HR

TX-001HR is a novel combination of 17ß-estradiol and natural progesterone under investigation for treating vasomotor symptoms related to menopause. If approved by the FDA, TX-001HR would represent the first bio-identical estradiol and progesterone approved for use in a single, combined product for postmenopausal women with an intact uterus offering women an important alternative to both the available FDA-approved synthetic (non-bio-identical) hormones and the unapproved compounded bio-identical hormone products. Bio-identical refers to estradiol and progesterone that are molecularly identical to the hormones circulating naturally in the woman’s body. An estimated one to two-and-a-half million women in the U.S. are using unapproved, compounded bio-identical hormone therapies to treat vasomotor symptoms.2 Leading medical societies and the FDA advise that compounded hormone therapies may pose significant risk to women given lack of efficacy and safety data and lack of uniform manufacturing processes.

TX-001HR was developed using TherapeuticsMD’s unique SYMBODATM technology (meaning “similar to the body”), which enables partial and complete solubilization of estradiol and progesterone into medium-chain fatty acid oils often derived from coconut oil.

About Menopause and Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS)

Menopause is a natural life-stage transition for women with an average onset of 51 years. According to the United States Census Bureau, approximately 43 million women in the U.S. are of menopausal age (45-64 years).3

As the ovaries stop producing hormones, levels of circulating estrogen decrease, often causing vasomotor symptoms (VMS) such as night sweats, hot flashes, and sleep disturbances. VMS affect as many as 60-80 percent of all menopausal women.

Menopausal women can benefit from hormone therapy (HT), also known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which is recognized by key medical societies as the most effective treatment for relief of symptoms related to menopause.","- TX-001HR, the first bio-identical combination therapy of estradiol and progesterone evaluated in a randomized, controlled clinical trial met all co-primary efficacy and safety endpoints at multiple doses -  - TX-001HR, if approved, offers a potential new alternative for millions of post-menopausal women currently using unapproved compounded hormone therapy for the treatment of VMS -  - Conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss results -  TherapeuticsMD, Inc. (NYSE MKT: TXMD), an innovative women’s healthcare company, today announced positive top-line results from its pivotal phase 3 Replenish Trial of TX-001HR, an investigational bio-identical hormone therapy combination of 17ß-estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel, for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) due to menopause in post-menopausal women with an intact uterus.  This Smart News Release features multimedia.

Mean Change from Baseline in Weekly Frequency of Moderate to Severe Hot Flashes for Weeks  ...  Figure 1. Mean Change from Baseline in Weekly Frequency of Moderate to Severe Hot Flashes for Weeks 1 to 12 (Graphic: Business Wire)  The Replenish Trial evaluated four doses of TX-001HR and placebo in 1,835 post-menopausal women between 40 and 65 years old. The doses studied were:  17ß-estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 416) 17ß-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 423) 17ß-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 421) 17ß-estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 424) Placebo (n = 151) The Replenish Trial results demonstrated:  TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both achieved all four of the co-primary efficacy endpoints and the primary safety endpoint. TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in both the frequency and severity of hot flashes compared to placebo. TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg were not statistically significant at all of the co-primary efficacy endpoints. The estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg dose was included in the clinical trial as a non-effective dose to meet the recommendation of the FDA guidance to identify the lowest effective dose. The incidence of consensus endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy was 0 percent across all four TX-001HR doses, meeting the recommendations established by the U.S. Food and Drug Agency’s (FDA) draft guidance.1 As outlined in the FDA guidance, the co-primary efficacy endpoints in the Replenish Trial were the change from baseline in the number and severity of hot flashes at weeks 4 and 12 as compared to placebo.1 The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia with up to 12 months of treatment. General safety was also evaluated.  The results of the Replenish Trial (p-values of < 0.05 meet FDA guidance and support evidence of efficacy) are summarized in the below table and included multimedia.  Replenish Trial Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints: Mean Change in Frequency and Severity of Hot Flashes Per Week Versus Placebo at Weeks 4 and 12, VMS-MITT Population Estradiol/Progesterone	 	1 mg/100 mg	 	0.5 mg/100 mg	 	0.5 mg/50 mg	 	0.25 mg/50 mg	 	Placebo  	 	(n = 141)	 	(n = 149)	 	(n = 147)	 	(n = 154)	 	(n = 135) Frequency  	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Week 4 P-value versus placebo		<0.001		0.013		0.141		0.001		- Week 12 P-value versus placebo	 	<0.001	 	<0.001	 	0.002	 	<0.001	 	-   Severity  	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Week 4 P-value versus placebo		0.031		0.005		0.401		0.100		- Week 12 P-value versus placebo	 	<0.001	 	<0.001	 	0.018	 	0.096	 	- Replenish Trial Primary Safety Endpoint: Incidence of Consensus Endometrial Hyperplasia or Malignancy up to 12 months, Endometrial Safety Population(Ŧ)  	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Endometrial Hyperplasia	 	0% (0/280)	 	0% (0/303)	 	0% (0/306)	 	0% (0/274)	 	0% (0/92) MITT = Modified intent to treat ŦPer FDA, consensus hyperplasia refers to the concurrence of two of the three pathologists be accepted as the final diagnosis1 P-value < 0.05 meets FDA guidance and supports evidence of efficacy “We are very pleased that multiple doses of TX-001HR studied in the Replenish Trial demonstrated these positive results, suggesting that, if approved, this drug product candidate is poised to address the significant demand for bio-identical hormone therapy,” said Chief Executive Officer Robert G. Finizio. “We have successfully advanced the science for post-menopausal women’s health by finding a way to effectively combine bio-identical estradiol and bio-identical progesterone. The need for a bio-identical FDA-approved combination therapy has been unanswered for decades, driving women to use unapproved drugs mixed together by independent and community pharmacies that compound these products. We believe that TX-001HR, if approved, will provide women, healthcare providers and pharmacists with a proven safe, effective and insurance reimbursed bio-identical combination product, finally answering that need. We will continue to evaluate these promising data, and look forward to submitting a New Drug Application for TX-001HR to the Food and Drug Administration as early as the third quarter of 2017.”  The trial also demonstrated a dose response favoring the higher doses of estradiol in combination with progesterone. The availability of multiple doses of TX-001HR would allow for individualized therapy to meet the needs of a diverse population of women.  The most common adverse events (>5 percent) reported on average in all the active treatment groups were headache, nasopharyngitis, breast tenderness, and upper respiratory infection. There was a very low reported incidence of adverse events of somnolence with TX-001HR, in contrast to commercially available oral progesterone where somnolence has been reported as a significant side effect. There were no unexpected safety signals.  The Replenish Trial evaluated various secondary endpoints using well-validated patient reported outcome tools, including the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL), the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI), and the responder analysis rate.

  SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 12, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Achaogen,
Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing
novel antibacterials addressing multi-drug resistant (MDR) gram-negative
infections, today announced that its lead product candidate, plazomicin, met
the objective of non-inferiority compared to meropenem for the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and achieved superiority for the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) primary efficacy endpoints in the Phase 3 EPIC
registration trial in patients with complicated urinary tract infections
(cUTI) and acute pyelonephritis (AP). In addition, in the Phase 3 CARE trial
in patients with serious infections due to carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) a lower rate of mortality or serious
disease-related complications was observed for plazomicin compared with
colistin therapy, one of the few remaining antibiotics for treatment of
infections due to CRE.
  ""We are thrilled with the outcome of both the EPIC and CARE clinical trials
and the potential opportunity for plazomicin to address many of the
multi-drug resistant bacterial infections occurring every day,"" said Kenneth
Hillan, M.B. Ch.B., Achaogen's Chief Executive Officer. ""We are grateful to
the patients and investigators who were involved in both of these studies,
and we look forward to seeking plazomicin's approval from FDA and EMA. We
believe that, if approved, plazomicin will provide an important new option
in treating MDR infections, including those caused by CRE.""
  Achaogen plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA), which will include
EPIC and CARE data, to the FDA in the second half of 2017. The Company also
plans to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the EMA in
2018. In addition, Achaogen plans to publicly present detailed results from
both the EPIC and CARE trials in 2017.
  ""These data are exceptional and better than I would have expected -
plazomicin's superiority in microbiologic cure for patients with cUTI at the
test-of-cure visit compared to meropenem, a gold standard for treating MDR
infections, is impressive. Importantly, the safety profile of the drug looks
favorable,"" said James A. McKinnell, Assistant Professor of Medicine at the
David Geffen School of Medicine and LA Biomed at Harbor-UCLA. ""The data from
the CARE trial provides compelling evidence for plazomicin as a treatment
option for serious infections due to CRE. The sample size for the CARE study
was small, but the data show a clear trend in favor of plazomicin in terms
of efficacy and overall safety compared to colistin. CRE infections cause
serious morbidity and mortality and seem to be on the rise. Based on these
data, plazomicin would be a valuable addition to my short list of available
treatment options for both empiric and directed treatment of patients, and
as a single agent or in combination with other antibiotics.""
  In the EPIC trial, plazomicin successfully met the objective of
non-inferiority compared to meropenem for the FDA-specified primary efficacy
endpoints, and achieved superiority for the EMA-specified primary efficacy
endpoints.
  Results for FDA pre-specified composite endpoint of clinical cure and
microbiological eradication in the microbiological modified intent-to-treat
(mMITT) population were as follows:
   -- Day 5: 88.0% plazomicin vs. 91.4% meropenem (difference -3.4%, 95% CI:
      -10.0, 3.1%), indicating statistical non-inferiority

  Plazomicin was well tolerated with no new safety concerns identified in the
EPIC trial. Total treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to renal
function were reported in 3.6% and 1.3% of patients in the plazomicin and
meropenem groups, respectively. TEAEs related to cochlear or vestibular
function were reported in a single patient in each of the plazomicin and
meropenem treatment groups. Both events were considered mild and resolved
completely.
  In the Phase 3 CARE trial in patients with serious infections due to CRE a
lower rate of mortality or serious disease-related complications was
observed for plazomicin compared with colistin therapy.
  Results from the CARE trial were as follows:

  The safety profile of plazomicin was favorable to that of colistin in
critically ill patients in the CARE trial. Study drug-related TEAEs related
to renal function were reported in 16.7% and 38.1% of patients in the
plazomicin and colistin groups, respectively. No TEAEs related to cochlear
or vestibular function were reported in either group.
  About the EPIC Trial
  EPIC (Evaluating plazomicin in cUTI) was a multinational, randomized,
controlled, double-blind clinical trial in adult patients with complicated
urinary tract infections (cUTI) and acute pyelonephritis (AP). The trial
enrolled 609 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive plazomicin 15 mg/kg
as a once daily 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion or meropenem 1.0 gram
every 8 hours as a 30 minute IV infusion. After a minimum of 4 days of IV
therapy, patients who met protocol-defined criteria for improvement were
allowed to step-down to oral levofloxacin to complete a total of 7 to 10
days of therapy (IV plus oral).
  About the CARE Trial
  CARE (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Enterobacteriaceae) was a
multinational, open label, Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy
and safety of plazomicin in patients with serious bacterial infections due
to CRE. The study included two cohorts of patients. Cohort 1 (N=39) was a
randomized, comparator-controlled cohort to compare plazomicin with colistin
(either in combination with meropenem or tigecycline) for the treatment of
bloodstream infection (BSI), hospital acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) or
ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) due to CRE. Cohort 1
enrolled 30 patients with BSI and 9 patients with HABP/VABP. Cohort 2 (N=30)
was a single-arm expanded access cohort to evaluate plazomicin-based therapy
in patients with BSI, HABP/VABP or cUTI due to CRE who were not eligible for
enrollment in Cohort 1.
  The primary analysis for Cohort 1 was conducted in the mMITT population
(patients with confirmed CRE infection) and was defined as all-cause
mortality at Day 28 or significant disease related complications. Due to
limitations of the small sample size, no formal statistical hypothesis
testing was performed, but a two-sided 90% exact confidence interval is
provided to describe the degree of variability around the observed
differences.","Achaogen Announces Positive Results in Phase 3 cUTI and CRE Clinical Trials of Plazomicin   -- EPIC registration trial successfully achieves FDA primary endpoints in patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) --   -- EPIC demonstrates superiority on EMA primary endpoints --   -- CARE descriptive trial shows 71 percent relative reduction in Day 28 all-cause mortality compared with colistin in patients with serious CRE infections --   -- Plazomicin well tolerated in both trials and shows improved overall safety compared with colistin in CARE trial --   -- Company plans to proceed with regulatory submissions in the U.S. and Europe --   -- Company to host a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. EST --   SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 12, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Achaogen, Inc.

No TEAEs related to cochlear or vestibular function were reported in either group.   About the EPIC Trial   EPIC (Evaluating plazomicin in cUTI) was a multinational, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial in adult patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and acute pyelonephritis (AP). The trial enrolled 609 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive plazomicin 15 mg/kg as a once daily 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion or meropenem 1.0 gram every 8 hours as a 30 minute IV infusion. After a minimum of 4 days of IV therapy, patients who met protocol-defined criteria for improvement were allowed to step-down to oral levofloxacin to complete a total of 7 to 10 days of therapy (IV plus oral).   About the CARE Trial   CARE (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Enterobacteriaceae) was a multinational, open label, Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of plazomicin in patients with serious bacterial infections due to CRE. The study included two cohorts of patients. Cohort 1 (N=39) was a randomized, comparator-controlled cohort to compare plazomicin with colistin (either in combination with meropenem or tigecycline) for the treatment of bloodstream infection (BSI), hospital acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) or ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) due to CRE. Cohort 1 enrolled 30 patients with BSI and 9 patients with HABP/VABP. Cohort 2 (N=30) was a single-arm expanded access cohort to evaluate plazomicin-based therapy in patients with BSI, HABP/VABP or cUTI due to CRE who were not eligible for enrollment in Cohort 1.   The primary analysis for Cohort 1 was conducted in the mMITT population (patients with confirmed CRE infection) and was defined as all-cause mortality at Day 28 or significant disease related complications. Due to limitations of the small sample size, no formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed, but a two-sided 90% exact confidence interval is provided to describe the degree of variability around the observed differences.",,120%

  WALTHAM, Mass., Dec. 13, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.
(Nasdaq:PRTO), a company developing novel, first-in-class therapeutics to
address the medical needs of patients with kidney and vascular diseases,
today announced that its first Phase 3 clinical trial with investigational
vonapanitase, PATENCY-1, did not meet its primary endpoint of improved
primary unassisted patency compared to placebo (p=0.254). However, the
top-line results for the trial's secondary endpoint suggested that
vonapanitase may improve secondary patency compared to placebo (p=0.048).
Data from one of the trial's three tertiary endpoints also suggested
vonapanitase may improve unassisted fistula use for hemodialysis (p=0.035)
and any use of the fistula (unassisted or assisted) for hemodialysis
(p=0.006). Adverse events reported for vonapanitase were similar to placebo.

  PATENCY-1 evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single dose of vonapanitase
in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving or expecting to
receive hemodialysis who underwent surgical creation of a radiocephalic
arteriovenous fistula. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolled 313 patients at 31 medical
centers in the United States. Patients in the trial were followed for up to
one year.
  The trial's primary endpoint, primary unassisted patency, is the length of
time from fistula surgical creation to the first occurrence of a fistula
thrombosis or corrective procedure to restore or maintain patency (blood
flow). In PATENCY-1, vonapanitase-treated patients had a 17% reduction in
the risk of primary unassisted patency loss over one year, compared to
placebo (p=0.254). At the end of one year, 42% of patients who received
vonapanitase retained primary unassisted patency, compared to 31% of
placebo-treated patients.
  The Kaplan-Meier curves for primary unassisted patency can be accessed in
Figure 1:
http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/fae4524b-a782-4332-87fd-550fa9fb87c2

  PATENCY-1's secondary endpoint, secondary patency, is the length of time
from surgical creation until fistula abandonment (final failure). In
PATENCY-1, vonapanitase-treated patients had a 34% reduction in the risk of
secondary patency loss over one year, compared to placebo (p=0.048). At the
end of one year, 74% of vonapanitase-treated patients maintained secondary
patency, compared to 61% of placebo-treated patients.
  The Kaplan-Meier curves for secondary patency can be accessed in Figure 2:
http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0e48c0e7-33e4-4053-8ecb-ee40f1dd2248

  Top-line results also included the following tertiary endpoint data:
   -- Use for Hemodialysis. 39.2% of vonapanitase-treated patients achieved
      unassisted use of their fistula for dialysis, compared to 25.0% of
      placebo-treated patients (p=0.035). 63.9% of vonapanitase-treated
      patients used their fistula for dialysis (unassisted or assisted),
      compared to 44.4% of placebo-treated patients (p=0.006). Use for
      hemodialysis was defined as continuous use of the fistula for
      hemodialysis for at least 90 days or, if hemodialysis was not initiated
      at least 90 days prior to the patient's last visit, for at least 30 days

      prior to the patient's last visit and in use at the patient's last
visit.
      Unassisted use was defined as use without prior loss of primary
      unassisted patency.

   -- Unassisted Maturation. 62.9% of vonapanitase-treated patients reached
      unassisted maturation, compared to 53.4% of placebo-treated patients
      (p=0.109). Unassisted maturation by ultrasound criteria, a tertiary
      endpoint, was defined as achieving a vein diameter >=4 millimeters and
      blood flow >=500 milliliters per minute by three months without loss of
      primary patency.

   -- Rate of Procedures to Restore or Maintain Patency. Over one year,
      vonapanitase-treated patients had 1.10 procedures per patient per year
      versus placebo-treated patients who had 1.48 procedures per patient per
      year (p=0.479). Procedures included thrombectomy, angioplasty, stent
      deployment and surgical revision.
  The proportions of patients reporting adverse events (AEs) were comparable
between the vonapanitase and placebo arms of the study. The most common AEs
were consistent with medical events experienced by CKD patients undergoing
radiocephalic fistula surgery and are summarized in the table below.
  Proportions of Patients Experiencing Common Adverse Events

                                       Vonapanitase   Placebo
 Adverse Events                            N=209       N=102
Vascular stenosis                         38.3%        40.2%
Fistula thrombosis                        19.6%        26.5%
Hypoaesthesia (numbness)                   5.3%         4.9%
Procedural pain                            4.8%         5.9%

Note: Includes any adverse event that occurred in
 at least 5% of patients in either treatment group.


  ""We are disappointed that the study missed the primary endpoint. However, it
appears that vonapanitase had a drug effect and we are encouraged by the
secondary patency and fistula use for hemodialysis findings in this trial,
both of which we believe are clinically important,"" said Steven Burke, M.D.,
Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Proteon Therapeutics. ""We
plan to review the full data set from PATENCY-1 and further investigate
these findings in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial, PATENCY-2.""
  ""We want to thank the clinical investigators and the patients and their
families who volunteered to participate in PATENCY-1.  We have always
recognized that this is an important and complex area of clinical
development and Proteon remains committed to the dialysis patient
community,"" stated Timothy Noyes, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Proteon Therapeutics. ""Because of the clinical importance of fistula
abandonment and fistula use for hemodialysis to both patients and
physicians, we plan to increase the planned enrollment of PATENCY-2 and look
for other ways to use these results to guide our development efforts.""
  As of November 30, 2016, Proteon had cash, cash equivalents and
available-for-sale investments of $43.3 million. The Company expects these
financial resources will be sufficient to fund its operations into the third
quarter of 2018 based upon changes to our operating plan that we intend to
implement.

  About PATENCY-1 and PATENCY-2
  PATENCY-1 and PATENCY-2 are Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic kidney disease
(CKD) receiving or expecting to receive hemodialysis and undergoing surgical
creation of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. The
studies were designed to evaluate, over one year, whether a single
administration of 30 micrograms of vonapanitase can improve radiocephalic
fistula patency, the period of time during which a fistula remains open with
adequate blood flow to enable hemodialysis. Proteon today announced results
of PATENCY-1, which enrolled 313 patients at 31 centers in the United
States. Proteon continues to enroll patients in PATENCY-2, the second Phase
3 clinical trial. Proteon expects to reach enrollment of 300 patients in
this trial at approximately 40 centers in the United States and Canada in
the first quarter of 2017. Proteon expects to report top-line results from
PATENCY-2 in the second quarter of 2018.
  About Chronic Kidney Disease, Hemodialysis and Vascular Access
  In the most severe stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD), also known as
kidney failure, the kidneys can no longer function to sustain life. The
majority of patients with kidney failure undergo chronic hemodialysis, which
requires a high-flow vascular access to repeatedly connect the patient's
bloodstream to a hemodialysis machine for this life-saving treatment. The
preferred form of vascular access for hemodialysis is a radiocephalic
arteriovenous fistula, created when a surgeon connects a vein to an artery
in the lower arm, resulting in a substantial increase in blood flow and vein
dilation. No FDA approved preventative treatments currently exist to improve
fistula patency.

The preferred form of vascular access for hemodialysis is a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula, created when a surgeon connects a vein to an artery in the lower arm, resulting in a substantial increase in blood flow and vein dilation. No FDA approved preventative treatments currently exist to improve fistula patency. ",,-70%

Conference Call and Webcast Today, December 12, 2016 at 8:30 a.m. ET - 
Ophthotech Corporation (Nasdaq:OPHT) today announced that the pre-specified primary endpoint of mean change in visual acuity at 12 months was not achieved in its two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials investigating the superiority of Fovista® (pegpleranib) anti-PDGF therapy in combination with Lucentis® (ranibizumab) anti-VEGF therapy compared to Lucentis® monotherapy for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The addition of Fovista® to a monthly Lucentis® regimen did not result in benefit as measured by the mean change in visual acuity at the 12 month time point. 

“We are very disappointed in the results from these trials, particularly for patients afflicted with wet AMD,” commented David R. Guyer, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Ophthotech. “We are thankful to the patients and clinical investigators and their staff for participating in the trials. We will continue to analyze the data from these two studies to better understand the trial results.” 

The two clinical trials (OPH1002 and OPH1003) were international, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, controlled Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of 1.5 mg of Fovista® administered in combination with Lucentis® (Fovista® combination therapy) compared to Lucentis® monotherapy. In each of these trials, patients were randomized to one of two approximately equal sized treatment groups. The two Phase 3 trials enrolled an aggregate of 1,248 patients with wet AMD. The results from the databases of the two trials were unmasked and analyzed concurrently. 

The combined analysis from the two trials (OPH1002 and OPH1003) showed that patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy gained a mean of 10.24 letters of vision on the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) standardized chart at 12 months, compared to a mean gain of 10.01 ETDRS letters for patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy, a difference of 0.23 ETDRS letters. In OPH1002, consisting of 619 treated patients, subjects receiving Fovista® combination therapy gained a mean of 10.74 letters of vision on the ETDRS standardized chart at 12 months, compared to a mean gain of 9.82 ETDRS letters in patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy, a resulting difference of 0.92 ETDRS letters (p=0.44). In OPH1003, consisting of 626 treated patients, subjects receiving Fovista® combination therapy gained a mean of 9.91 letters of vision on the ETDRS standardized chart at 12 months, compared to a mean gain of 10.36 ETDRS letters in patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy, a resulting difference of -0.44 ETDRS letters (p=0.71). None of these results of the pre-specified primary efficacy analysis were statistically significant. 

In the pooled analysis of pre-specified secondary endpoints from both trials, 24.2% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy gained 20 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 22.1% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. In OPH1002, 25.9% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy gained 20 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 20.0% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. In OPH1003, 22.5% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy gained 20 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 24.1% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. 

In the pooled analysis, 12.1% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy lost 5 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 11.2% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. In OPH1002, 12.0% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy lost 5 or more ETDRS letters at month 12, compared to 12.3% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. In OPH1003, 12.2% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy lost 5 or more ETDRS letters at month 12, compared to 10.2% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. 

In addition, in the pooled analysis, 13.5% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy achieved visual acuity of 20/25 or better at month 12, compared to 13.9% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. In OPH1002, 13.6% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy achieved visual acuity of 20/25 or better, compared to 13.2% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. In OPH1003, 13.5% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy achieved visual acuity of 20/25 or better, compared to 14.6% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. 

Based on a preliminary analysis of the safety data from these two trials, Fovista® combination therapy and Lucentis® monotherapy were generally well tolerated after one year of treatment. The ocular adverse events more frequently reported in the Fovista® combination therapy group compared to the Lucentis® monotherapy group were mainly related to the injection procedure. The incidence of reported serious systemic adverse events was generally similar in both treatment groups as was the incidence of myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident.

Potential Study of Egalet-002
  PR Newswire
  WAYNE, Pa., Dec. 16, 2016
  WAYNE, Pa., Dec. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Egalet Corporation (Nasdaq: EGLT)
(""Egalet""), a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on
developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative treatments for pain and
other conditions, today announced positive top-line results from a Category
3 intranasal human abuse potential (HAP) study of Egalet-002, an
abuse-deterrent, extended-release oxycodone product candidate which uses
Egalet's Guardian(TM) Technology. Egalet-002 is in late-stage development
for the management of pain severe enough to require daily around-the-clock,
long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are
inadequate.
  ""Given that intranasal abuse is the most common form of non-oral oxycodone
abuse, these results, having hit the primary endpoint of reduced maximum
drug liking, are promising,"" said Bob Radie, president and chief executive
officer. ""We will look to submit the full data for presentation at a medical
meeting in 2017.""
  Egalet-002 was designed using a version of Egalet's proprietary Guardian
Technology that contains an inner matrix and an exterior shell. This results
in tablets with controlled-release properties as well as physical and
chemical features that have been demonstrated to resist both common and
rigorous methods of manipulation, in order to deter common routes of abuse.
The physical hardness of the tablet and the gelling effect of the matrix are
designed to give Egalet-002 its physical and chemical abuse-deterrent
characteristics.
  The study was a randomized, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled
6-period crossover study. The study evaluated the abuse potential of
manipulated Egalet-002 compared to crushed immediate-release (IR) oxycodone
through the nasal route in 46 non-dependent recreational opioid users
experienced in nasal insufflation. A comparison to manipulated OxyContin(R)
(oxycodone hydrochloride) was also included as an exploratory arm. The study
was conducted in accordance with the FDA's Guidance for Industry,
Abuse-Deterrent Opioids -- Evaluation and Labeling (April, 2015), and used
more aggressive methods of manipulation for Egalet-002 identified from the
Category 1 in vitro laboratory studies which were needed to get Egalet-002
into a snortable form.
  The treatment periods included: Egalet-002 40 mg (manipulated with shell
on), Egalet-002 40 mg (manipulated with shell taken off through an
additional manipulation step), crushed IR oxycodone 40 mg, manipulated
OxyContin 40 mg, manipulated Egalet-002 placebo tablet, and placebo powder.
The primary study endpoint was Drug Liking measured on a bipolar 100-point
scale, where 50 is neutral, 100 is maximum liking and 0 is maximum
disliking.
  Top-line results from the study include:
   -- For the primary comparison, the difference in maximum Drug Liking (Emax)

      between manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell on; 79.5) was significantly
      lower compared to crushed IR oxycodone (86.6); p = 0.0004

          -- This outcome was also significant for the comparison between
             manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell off; 77.4) and crushed IR
             oxycodone (86.6); p < 0.0001

   -- For the secondary outcome of Take Drug Again (measured on a bipolar
      100-point scale), the results were 69.9 for manipulated Egalet-002
(shell
      on), 72.4 for manipulated Egalet-002 (shell off), and 75.5 for crushed
IR
      oxycodone; not statistically significant for either comparison

   -- In the exploratory analysis with OxyContin, Emax Drug Liking was similar

      in all treatment arms: manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell on; 79.5),
      manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell off; 77.4), and manipulated OxyContin

      (76.2)

          -- Ease of Snorting and Pleasantness of Snorting were also assessed
             using unipolar 100-point scales where 100 represented 'very
             easy'/'very pleasant' and 0 meant 'very hard'/'very unpleasant';
             results were as follows:

                 -- Ease of Snorting was significantly harder for manipulated
                    Egalet-002 (with shell on; 42.0) and manipulated
Egalet-002
                    (with shell off; 49.5) compared to manipulated OxyContin
                    (65.1); p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0050, respectively

                 -- Pleasantness of Snorting was significantly lower for
                    manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell on; 40.7) and
                    manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell off; 44.7) compared to
                    manipulated OxyContin (55.3); p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0081,
                    respectively
  Guardian(TM) Technology
  Egalet's Guardian Technology has many applications and has been used to
develop abuse-deterrent forms of commonly abused prescription medications.
Egalet's proprietary Guardian Technology is a polymer matrix tablet
technology that utilizes a novel application of the well characterized
manufacturing process of injection molding, which results in tablets that
are more difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse. This approach offers
the ability to design tablets with controlled-release profiles as well as
physical and chemical properties that have been demonstrated to resist both
common and rigorous methods of manipulation. Tablets manufactured with
Guardian Technology have been shown to have increased resistance to physical
methods of manipulation, such as cutting, crushing, grinding or breaking
using a variety of tools. They are also resistant to chemical manipulation
and extraction and turn into a viscous hydrogel on contact with liquid,
making syringeability very difficult. Egalet-002 was designed using a
version of Egalet's proprietary Guardian Technology that contains an inner
matrix and an exterior shell while ARYMO ER uses a different version of the
Guardian Technology.

  Intra-Cellular Therapies to Host a Conference Call Today at 4:45 p.m. ET to
Discuss Results
  NEW YORK, Sept. 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc.
(NASDAQ:ITCI) today announced top-line results from the second Phase 3
clinical trial (Study '302) of ITI-007, an oral, first-in-class
investigational medicine for the treatment of schizophrenia. In this trial,
neither dose of ITI-007 separated from placebo on the primary endpoint,
change from baseline on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
total score, in the pre-defined patient population. The active control,
risperidone, did separate from placebo.  In this trial, ITI-007 was
statistically significantly better than risperidone on key safety and
tolerability parameters and exhibited a safety profile similar to placebo.
This replicates the safety and tolerability findings of a previous study
(our Phase 2 Study '005) in which the efficacy of ITI-007 60 mg and
risperidone, the active control, were similar. We believe ITI-007 did not
separate from placebo on the pre-specified primary endpoint in Study '302 in
part due to an unusually high placebo response at certain sites which
disproportionately affected the trial results and contributed to the
efficacy outcome of this study compared to our two previous positive
efficacy studies. Drug development in psychiatry faces numerous challenges
and approved antipsychotics have had negative results as part of their
clinical development programs. We are committed and adequately resourced to
continue the development of ITI-007 for the treatment of schizophrenia. We
believe the ITI-007 late-stage clinical development program, including two
large, well-controlled positive studies and supportive evidence from this
Study '302, collectively provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of
ITI-007 for the treatment of schizophrenia. Across all three of our efficacy
trials, ITI-007 60 mg improved symptoms of schizophrenia with the same
magnitude of change from baseline in the primary endpoint, the PANSS total
score. We plan to request a meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's (FDA) Division of Psychiatry Products to discuss the
regulatory path for this first-in-class investigational agent.
  ""It is not uncommon in the field of psychiatry for studies to be challenged
by high placebo response and there has been great variability in the effects
observed from one study to the next,"" said Christoph Corell, M.D., Professor
of Psychiatry at Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine. ""Taken together, the
ITI-007 schizophrenia program supports ITI-007 as a unique medication with
an unprecedented safety and tolerability profile. Moreover, efficacy has
been demonstrated in two large-scale schizophrenia studies to date. In one
of these studies, ITI-007 and risperidone, the active control, had similar
efficacy. In light of the results to date, I believe that ITI-007 represents
a unique investigational medication which has the potential to advance the
treatment of patients suffering from schizophrenia.""
  In this study, consistent with our previous schizophrenia studies, ITI-007
was well-tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo. There were no
clinically significant differences with ITI-007 from placebo in akathisia,
extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin, body weight, glucose, insulin, and
lipids. As expected, risperidone demonstrated a statistically significant
increase in weight gain, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and prolactin
compared to placebo. These increases have a negative impact on patients. In
contrast, ITI-007 was statistically significantly better than risperidone on
all of these tolerability parameters. There were no significant increases
observed with ITI-007 versus placebo on any of these parameters. There
continues to be a need for safer and more tolerable medications for patients
with schizophrenia, which are not associated with the motoric and
cardio-metabolic side effects of many existing treatments, thereby
potentially improving compliance and reducing relapse and hospitalizations.
We believe ITI-007 has the potential to address this need.
  ""Based on the strength of the clinical data generated in this program to
date, including two positive studies, supportive evidence from Study '302
and a consistent, well-tolerated and placebo-like safety profile across all
studies, we continue to believe ITI-007 will be an important treatment for
patients suffering from schizophrenia. We remain committed to the
development of ITI-007 for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar
depression, agitation associated with dementia, including Alzheimer's
disease and other neuropsychiatric indications,""  said Dr. Sharon Mates,
Chairman and CEO of ITCI.
  About the ITI-007 Schizophrenia Program
  The ITI-007 clinical program in schizophrenia includes three randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The Phase 2 trial (Study '005) was
positive and was completed in 2013 with 335 patients.  The first Phase 3
trial (Study '301) was positive and was completed in September 2015 with 450
patients. Today, we are reporting top-line results from our second Phase 3
trial (Study '302) with 696 patients.
  About the ITI-007-302 Trial: This randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose,
placebo- and active-controlled inpatient clinical trial was conducted at 13
sites in the United States consisting of 696 patients randomized (1:1:1:1)
to receive ITI-007 60 or 20 mg, risperidone 4 mg as the active control, or
placebo once daily in the morning for six weeks. Risperidone required a dose
titration from 2 mg to 4 mg while no dose titration was required for
ITI-007. Patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia (using DSM-5 criteria)
and were required to have an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms. The
pre-specified primary efficacy measure was change from baseline versus
placebo at study endpoint (6 weeks) on the centrally rated PANSS total
score.  The PANSS is a well-validated 30-item rating scale that measures the
ability of a drug to reduce schizophrenia symptom severity.
  In this study, approximately 79% of patients on placebo completed treatment
compared to approximately 75% with 60 mg, 68% with 20 mg and only 63% for
risperidone.
  ITI-007 60 mg and 20 mg demonstrated a change from baseline on the PANSS
total score of -14.6 points and -15.0 points respectively versus a -15.1
point change in placebo. Risperidone, the active control, demonstrated a
change from baseline on the PANSS total score of -20.5 points.
  In the context of the ITI-007 development program, ITI-007 60 mg improved
symptoms of schizophrenia with the same magnitude of change from baseline on
the PANSS total score across all three studies (-13.2 points in Study '005,
-14.5 points in Study '301 as compared with -13.2 points at week 4 and -14.6
points at week 6 in Study '302). The magnitude of change for ITI-007 60 mg
was similar to the active control, risperidone (-13.4 points) in Study '005.
The trajectory of improvement with ITI-007 60 mg was similar across all
three studies.
  An unusually high placebo response was observed in this study compared with
previous studies   (-15.1 point change from baseline on PANSS total score in
Study '302 in contrast to -7.4 points in Study '005 and -10.3 points in
Study '301).

  About Schizophrenia
  Schizophrenia is a disabling and chronic mental illness affecting over 1% of
the world's population. Schizophrenia is characterized by multiple symptoms
during an acute phase of the disorder that can include so-called ""positive""
symptoms, such as hearing voices, grandiose beliefs and suspiciousness or
paranoia. These symptoms can be accompanied by additional, harder-to-treat
symptoms, such as social withdrawal, blunted emotional response and speech
deficits, collectively referred to as ""negative"" symptoms, difficulty
concentrating and disorganized thoughts, or cognitive impairment, depression
and insomnia. Such residual symptoms often persist even after the acute
positive symptoms subside, and contribute substantially to the social and
employment disability associated with schizophrenia. Current antipsychotic
medications provide some relief for the symptoms associated with the acute
phase of the disorder, but they do not effectively treat the residual phase
symptoms associated with chronic schizophrenia. Currently available
medications used to treat acute schizophrenia are limited in their use due
to side effects that can include movement disorders, weight gain, metabolic
disturbances, and cardiovascular disorders. There is an unmet medical need
for new therapies.","Intra-Cellular Therapies Announces Top-Line Results from the Second Phase 3 Trial of ITI-007 in Patients with Schizophrenia (Study '302)   Intra-Cellular Therapies to Host a Conference Call Today at 4:45 p.m. ET to Discuss Results   NEW YORK, Sept. 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc.

(NASDAQ: IONS) today provided an update on the IONIS-TTR(Rx) program.  Ionis
is currently evaluating IONIS-TTR(Rx) in an ongoing Phase 3 study,
NEURO-TTR, in patients with transthyretin (TTR) familial amyloid
polyneuropathy.  Dr. Merrill Benson is also evaluating IONIS-TTR(Rx) in an
investigator-initiated Phase 2 open-label study in patients with TTR-related
amyloid cardiomyopathy.
  GSK, which has an option to exclusively license IONIS-TTR(Rx) , has decided
not to initiate a Phase 3 outcome study, CARDIO-TTR, which was planned to
evaluate IONIS-TTR(Rx) in patients with TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy.  As
announced in April 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had
placed this study on clinical hold as a result of safety findings in the
ongoing NEURO-TTR study.  GSK will consider options for TTR amyloid
cardiomyopathy once additional clinical data are available from the ongoing
studies.
  Both the NEURO-TTR and Dr. Benson's study should provide important data on
patients with TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy, which could contribute to the
design of an optimal Phase 3 study.  In addition to Dr. Benson's
investigator-initiated study in patients with TTR-related amyloid
cardiomyopathy, the NEURO-TTR study is also evaluating patients with
TTR-related cardiomyopathy using a cardiac substudy to evaluate patients who
have cardiac involvement in addition to their polyneuropathy. Approximately
half of the patients in the NEURO-TTR study also have TTR-related amyloid
cardiomyopathy.  The NEURO-TTR study and Dr. Benson's study are both
proceeding on track, with the data from the NEURO-TTR study planned in the
first half of 2017.  Updated data from Dr. Benson's study will be presented
at the International Symposium on Amyloidosis in July 2016.  Together, Ionis
and GSK, are actively preparing for an NDA filing.
  ""We are committed to advancing IONIS-TTR(Rx) as a potentially first-in-class
and best-in-class therapy for all patients suffering from TTR amyloidosis, a
severe, progressive and fatal disease. We are encouraged by the strong
retention we have observed in the NEURO-TTR study and the robust
participation and the substantial reductions in TTR protein we are observing
in the open-label extension study.  We are also encouraged by the results to
date from Dr. Benson's study in a small number of patients with the cardiac
form of the disease as presented at the European Congress on Hereditary ATTR

  ABOUT TTR AMYLOIDOSIS
  TTR amyloidosis is a severe, progressive and fatal disease with multiple
overlapping clinical manifestations.  There are three forms of TTR
amyloidosis:  familial amyloid polyneuropathy, FAP, familial amyloid
cardiomyopathy, FAC, and wild type (wt)-TTR amyloidosis.  The disease is
caused by the accumulation of misfolded TTR protein in a broad range of
tissues and organs, including peripheral nerves, heart, intestinal tract,
eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone.  The progressive
accumulation of TTR amyloid deposits in these tissues and organs leads to
organ failure and eventually death.  Therapeutic options for the treatment
of patients with TTR amyloidosis are very limited.
  FAP is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded mutated TTR protein
primarily in the peripheral nerves. Patients with FAP experience ongoing
debilitating nerve damage throughout their body resulting in the progressive
loss of motor functions, such as walking.  These patients also accumulate
TTR in other major organs, which progressively compromise their function and
eventually leads to death within five to fifteen years of disease onset.
There are an estimated 10,000 FAP patients worldwide.
  TTR-related amyloid cardiomyopathy is characterized by the accumulation of
misfolded TTR protein primarily in the cardiac muscle.  Patients experience
ongoing debilitating heart damage resulting in progressive heart failure,
which results in death within 5 to 7 years from disease onset. TTR-related
amyloid cardiomyopathy includes both the genetic form of the disease, FAC,
and the wild-type form of the disease, wt-TTR amyloidosis. There are an
estimated 40,000 FAC patients worldwide. Patients with FAC begin to
experience symptom onset between 50 and 60 years of age, whereas patients
with wt-TTR amyloidosis usually begin to experience symptom onset ten or
more years later, generally over 70 years of age. There are an estimated
200,000 wt-TTR amyloidosis patients worldwide.
  Often patients with the polyneuropathy form of TTR amyloidosis will also
have TTR build up in the heart and also experience cardiomyopathy symptoms.
Similarly, patients with the cardiomyopathy form of TTR amyloidosis may
often have TTR build up in their peripheral nerves and can experience nerve
damage and progressive difficulty with motor functions.

Ionis is currently evaluating IONIS-TTR(Rx) in an ongoing Phase 3 study, NEURO-TTR, in patients with transthyretin (TTR) familial amyloid polyneuropathy.  Dr. Merrill Benson is also evaluating IONIS-TTR(Rx) in an investigator-initiated Phase 2 open-label study in patients with TTR-related amyloid cardiomyopathy.   GSK, which has an option to exclusively license IONIS-TTR(Rx) , has decided not to initiate a Phase 3 outcome study, CARDIO-TTR, which was planned to evaluate IONIS-TTR(Rx) in patients with TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy.  As announced in April 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had placed this study on clinical hold as a result of safety findings in the ongoing NEURO-TTR study.  GSK will consider options for TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy once additional clinical data are available from the ongoing studies.   Both the NEURO-TTR and Dr. Benson's study should provide important data on patients with TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy, which could contribute to the design of an optimal Phase 3 study.  In addition to Dr. Benson's investigator-initiated study in patients with TTR-related amyloid cardiomyopathy, the NEURO-TTR study is also evaluating patients with TTR-related cardiomyopathy using a cardiac substudy to evaluate patients who have cardiac involvement in addition to their polyneuropathy. Approximately half of the patients in the NEURO-TTR study also have TTR-related amyloid cardiomyopathy.  The NEURO-TTR study and Dr. Benson's study are both proceeding on track, with the data from the NEURO-TTR study planned in the first half of 2017.  Updated data from Dr. Benson's study will be presented at the International Symposium on Amyloidosis in July 2016.  Together, Ionis and GSK, are actively preparing for an NDA filing.   ""We are committed to advancing IONIS-TTR(Rx) as a potentially first-in-class and best-in-class therapy for all patients suffering from TTR amyloidosis, a severe, progressive and fatal disease. We are encouraged by the strong retention we have observed in the NEURO-TTR study and the robust participation and the substantial reductions in TTR protein we are observing in the open-label extension study.  We are also encouraged by the results to date from Dr. Benson's study in a small number of patients with the cardiac form of the disease as presented at the European Congress on Hereditary ATTR Amyloidosis meeting in Paris last year,"" said Dr. Brett Monia, senior vice president of Ionis antisense drug discovery.

  - Company to Host Conference Call and Webcast Today at 5:00 p.m. ET -
  CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 15, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agios Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (Nasdaq:AGIO), a leader in the fields of cancer metabolism and rare
genetic metabolic disorders, today announced that it is no longer developing
its second pyruvate kinase-R (PKR) activator, AG-519, and withdrew its
investigational new drug (IND) application yesterday following a verbal
notification of a clinical hold from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). These decisions do not affect the Company's ongoing global Phase 2
study (DRIVE PK) for AG-348, a novel, first-in-class activator of both
wild-type (normal) and mutated PKR enzymes. Agios is advancing AG-348 into
pivotal development as the first potential disease-modifying treatment for
pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency.
  ""We share the FDA's commitment to patient safety and believe this is the
right decision to ultimately help people with PK deficiency,"" said David
Schenkein, M.D., chief executive officer at Agios. ""As the lead compound in
our PKR program, AG-348 has demonstrated clear proof of concept with robust,
rapid and sustained increases in hemoglobin in patients with PK deficiency.
Based on our clinical experience with DRIVE PK, we are developing a
registration path for AG-348 in adult PK deficiency patients and plan to
discuss this strategy with regulators.""
  DRIVE PK is an ongoing global Phase 2, open-label safety and efficacy trial
and the first study evaluating AG-348 in adult, transfusion-independent
patients with PK deficiency. The study target enrollment has been reached
with a total of 52 patients. In total, 124 patients and healthy volunteers
have been treated with AG-348 since studies were initiated in 2014. As of
the September 23, 2016 data cut-off, AG-348 was well-tolerated with the
majority of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) Grade 1-2; the most
frequent being headache, nausea and insomnia. AG-348 also demonstrated
clinically relevant, rapid and sustained hemoglobin increases in 15 of 26
patients with at least one missense mutation, and in 15 out of 32 patients
overall.
  AG-519 was evaluated in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study in the United
Kingdom to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics
and bioavailability. A previously disclosed case of drug-induced cholestatic
hepatitis occurred in the bioavailability portion of the study and this
volunteer continues to be monitored. No additional adverse events have been
reported. In addition, AG-519 was undergoing a palatability (taste test)
study in volunteers in the United States to develop a formulation for
potential future development. In total, 98 volunteers have received AG-519
and no volunteers or patients are currently receiving the drug.

  About Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency and Genetic Background
  PK deficiency is a rare inherited disease that presents as hemolytic anemia,
which is the accelerated destruction of red blood cells. The inherited
mutations in PKR enzymes cause a deficit in cellular energy within the red
blood cell, as evidenced by lower pyruvate kinase enzyme activity and a
decline in ATP levels and a build-up of upstream metabolites, including
2,3-DPG.
  The current standard of care for PK deficiency is supportive, including
blood transfusions, splenectomy, chelation therapy to address iron overload
and/or interventions for other treatment- and disease-related morbidities.
There is no approved therapy to treat the underlying cause of PK deficiency.

  PK deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease whereby all patients inherit
two mutations, one from each parent. More than 250 different mutations have
been identified to date. The mutations observed in PK deficiency patients
are classified in two main categories. A missense mutation causes a single
amino acid change in the protein, generally resulting in some functional
protein.  A non-missense mutation is any mutation other than a missense
mutation, generally resulting in little functional protein. It is estimated
that 53 percent of patients with PK deficiency have two missense mutations,
25 percent have one missense and one non-missense mutation, and 22 percent
have two non-missense mutations(1) .
  Boston Children's Hospital, in collaboration with Agios, is conducting a
Natural History Study to better understand the symptoms and complications of
PK deficiency, identify patients and treatment centers, and capture other
clinical data, including quality of life measures and genetic information.

Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCUL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye, today announced positive topline results from its phase 3 clinical trial of DEXTENZA™ (dexamethasone insert) 0.4 mg, for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain. DEXTENZA is a product candidate administered by a physician as a bioresorbable intracanalicular insert and designed for drug release to the ocular surface for up to 30 days.

The trial successfully met its two primary efficacy endpoints for inflammation and pain, achieving statistically significant differences between the treatment group and the placebo group for the absence of inflammatory cells on day 14 and the absence of pain on day 8, respectively. 52.3%% of patients treated with DEXTENZA showed an absence of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the study eye on day 14, compared to 31.1% of those receiving the placebo vehicle control punctum plug (p< 0.0001). 79.6% of patients treated with DEXTENZA reported absence of pain in the study eye on day 8, compared to 61.3% of those receiving the placebo vehicle control punctum plug (p< 0.0001). For clarification of the endpoints, the day of surgery and insertion of DEXTENZA or the placebo is considered to be day 1.

“The successful results of this trial represent an important milestone for the Company, and we believe these results not only further validate the ability of DEXTENZA to provide a full post-operative course of therapy with a one-time administration, but also validate the broader utility of our multi-faceted hydrogel drug delivery technology platform,” said Amar Sawhney, Ph.D., President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. “We are preparing for the resubmission to our NDA for DEXTENZA for the post-surgical ocular pain indication by the end of the year, and subject to potential approval, we plan to submit an NDA supplement for DEXTENZA to include a post-surgical ocular inflammation indication. This is an exciting time for Ocular Therapeutix, as we advance our lead drug delivery product candidate toward potential commercialization.”

In this Phase 3 clinical trial with DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain, as well as other DEXTENZA clinical trials completed to date regardless of indication, DEXTENZA has exhibited a strong safety profile and has been generally well-tolerated. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events observed in this Phase 3 clinical trial. DEXTENZA inserts were visible in almost all subjects through Day 30, with 99% present at the primary efficacy endpoint visits.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included differences between the DEXTENZA treatment group and the placebo group for the absence of anterior chamber (AC) cells at day 2, 4, 14 and 30 and for the absence of pain at day 2, 4, 14 and 30. All eight of these secondary endpoints were met at a level of statistical significance with the exception of the endpoint for the absence of AC cells at day 2. Additional secondary endpoints including flare, as well as an assessment of all safety data, are being evaluated.

“In parallel with steadily rising ophthalmic surgical volumes among the aging U.S. population is the requirement for safe and effective outcomes, driven not only by operative technique but also by appropriate post-operative drug delivery,” said Dr. Terry Kim, Chief of the Cornea and External Disease Service at the Duke University Eye Center and Professor of Ophthalmology, Duke University School of Medicine. “DEXTENZA’s demonstrated ability to provide a full post-operative course of therapy with a single placement is attractive for both patients and physicians. A large majority of my patients show poor compliance and improper technique when using current standard of care steroid eye drops, which can lead to prolonged recovery and suboptimal outcomes as well as unnecessary phone calls and office visits to the physician. DEXTENZA has the potential to improve both compliance and outcomes, enabling the transfer of control back to the physician for the entire course of therapy.”

Phase 3 Study Design

This prospective, multicenter, 1:1 randomized, parallel-arm, double-masked, vehicle-controlled study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery. The study enrolled 438 patients who were undergoing clear corneal cataract surgery at 21 sites throughout the United States. Immediately following surgery, patients were randomized to either DEXTENZA or a placebo vehicle. Primary efficacy endpoints evaluated the differences between the DEXTENZA treatment group and the placebo group for the absence of anterior chamber cells at day 14 and absence of pain at day 8.

This was the third Phase 3 clinical trial that the Company has conducted with DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery. Based on the results from the first two Phase 3 clinical trials, Ocular Therapeutix submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular pain occurring after ophthalmic surgery. The purpose of conducting this third Phase 3 clinical trial is part of the Company’s label expansion strategy for DEXTENZA. Accordingly, subject to the approval of the NDA for post-surgical ocular pain by the FDA, Ocular Therapeutix intends to submit an NDA supplement for DEXTENZA to broaden its label to include a post-surgical inflammation indication.

About Ocular Inflammation and Pain Following Ophthalmic Surgery

Ocular pain and inflammation are common side effects following ophthalmic surgery. Physicians prescribe topical corticosteroids as part of the standard of post-operative care. If left untreated, inflammation of the eye may result in further ocular complications, including scarring and vision loss. According to US Census data, by the year 2020, it is estimated that the number of Americans diagnosed with cataracts is expected to rise to approximately 30 million, representing a 31.9% increase over current prevalence estimates. Approximately 3.8 million cataract cases were performed in the United States in 2015.","Conference Call Today at 8:30 am Eastern Time  Ocular Therapeutix, Inc.

This is an exciting time for Ocular Therapeutix, as we advance our lead drug delivery product candidate toward potential commercialization.”  In this Phase 3 clinical trial with DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain, as well as other DEXTENZA clinical trials completed to date regardless of indication, DEXTENZA has exhibited a strong safety profile and has been generally well-tolerated. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events observed in this Phase 3 clinical trial. DEXTENZA inserts were visible in almost all subjects through Day 30, with 99% present at the primary efficacy endpoint visits.  Secondary efficacy endpoints included differences between the DEXTENZA treatment group and the placebo group for the absence of anterior chamber (AC) cells at day 2, 4, 14 and 30 and for the absence of pain at day 2, 4, 14 and 30. All eight of these secondary endpoints were met at a level of statistical significance with the exception of the endpoint for the absence of AC cells at day 2. Additional secondary endpoints including flare, as well as an assessment of all safety data, are being evaluated.  “In parallel with steadily rising ophthalmic surgical volumes among the aging U.S. population is the requirement for safe and effective outcomes, driven not only by operative technique but also by appropriate post-operative drug delivery,” said Dr. Terry Kim, Chief of the Cornea and External Disease Service at the Duke University Eye Center and Professor of Ophthalmology, Duke University School of Medicine. “DEXTENZA’s demonstrated ability to provide a full post-operative course of therapy with a single placement is attractive for both patients and physicians. A large majority of my patients show poor compliance and improper technique when using current standard of care steroid eye drops, which can lead to prolonged recovery and suboptimal outcomes as well as unnecessary phone calls and office visits to the physician. DEXTENZA has the potential to improve both compliance and outcomes, enabling the transfer of control back to the physician for the entire course of therapy.”  Phase 3 Study Design  This prospective, multicenter, 1:1 randomized, parallel-arm, double-masked, vehicle-controlled study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery. The study enrolled 438 patients who were undergoing clear corneal cataract surgery at 21 sites throughout the United States. Immediately following surgery, patients were randomized to either DEXTENZA or a placebo vehicle. Primary efficacy endpoints evaluated the differences between the DEXTENZA treatment group and the placebo group for the absence of anterior chamber cells at day 14 and absence of pain at day 8.  This was the third Phase 3 clinical trial that the Company has conducted with DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery. Based on the results from the first two Phase 3 clinical trials, Ocular Therapeutix submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular pain occurring after ophthalmic surgery. The purpose of conducting this third Phase 3 clinical trial is part of the Company’s label expansion strategy for DEXTENZA. Accordingly, subject to the approval of the NDA for post-surgical ocular pain by the FDA, Ocular Therapeutix intends to submit an NDA supplement for DEXTENZA to broaden its label to include a post-surgical inflammation indication.  About Ocular Inflammation and Pain Following Ophthalmic Surgery  Ocular pain and inflammation are common side effects following ophthalmic surgery. Physicians prescribe topical corticosteroids as part of the standard of post-operative care. If left untreated, inflammation of the eye may result in further ocular complications, including scarring and vision loss. According to US Census data, by the year 2020, it is estimated that the number of Americans diagnosed with cataracts is expected to rise to approximately 30 million, representing a 31.9% increase over current prevalence estimates. Approximately 3.8 million cataract cases were performed in the United States in 2015.",,

  NEW YORK, Oct. 25, 2016
  NEW YORK, Oct. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(NASDAQ: DPRX) (""Dipexium"" or the ""Company"") today announced that the
OneStep-1 and OneStep-2 Phase 3 clinical trials of Locilex(R) (pexiganan
cream 0.8%) in patients with mild infections of diabetic foot ulcers (Mild
DFI) did not meet the primary clinical endpoint of superiority versus
vehicle plus standardized wound care and also did not show any meaningful
difference in wound closure rate between the Locilex arm and the vehicle arm
in each study.  Neither trial met the secondary endpoint of demonstrating a
higher rate of eradication of bacteria for the Locilex arm.  While the
overall adverse event incidence was comparable to vehicle alone, serious
adverse events with Locilex included higher than anticipated osteomyelitis
and cellulitis in the Locilex arm of each study.
  David P. Luci, President & CEO of Dipexium, stated, ""Although we are
disappointed with these results, we are continuing to evaluate the data and
will consider potential regulatory pathways forward in other possible
clinical indications based on an evaluation of all data emerging from the
Phase 3 studies.""
  Benjamin A. Lipsky, MD, FACP, FIDSA, FRCP, Chair of the OneStep trials and
lead author of the 2012 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)
Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Diabetic Foot
Infections stated, ""Speaking as Chairman of the OneStep trials, and on
behalf of Warren Joseph, DPM, FIDSA, Co-Chair, we are certainly disappointed
that we did not see a clear advantage to treating these patients with Mild
DFI with Locilex cream. As diabetic foot infection is a complex problem, and
this trial generated a great deal of data, we are currently reviewing the
results to better interpret the outcome.  I can, however, say that these
pioneering studies were carefully designed and operationally well conducted.
 In over 30 years of conducting DFI clinical trials, I have not seen a more
diligent or careful approach to ensuring patient safety and accurate data.
The results of this study will provide important information regardless of
the outcome. This will include a better understanding of the natural course
of diabetic foot ulcer and infection, and a recognition that some Mild DFI
patients may not need antibacterial treatment.  The exemplary conduct of the
trial reflects extremely well on the participating investigators. We look
forward to continuing analyses of the wealth of data accumulated and to
report more details of our findings.""
  Robert J. DeLuccia, Executive Chairman of Dipexium, emphasized, ""The OneStep
trials were the first ever 'placebo'-controlled studies conducted for mildly
infected diabetic foot ulcers.  In these studies, the 'placebo' was the
cream vehicle without pexiganan, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in
Locilex.  These complex trials required stringent standardized wound care,
in both study arms, including ulcer debridement, daily wound dressing
changes and pressure off-loading devices.  Since antibiotics are generally
used by clinicians to treat an infected ulcer, no clinical trial in diabetic
foot infection has ever established a 'response rate' for an ulcer infection
that had standardized wound care but was untreated with an antibiotic.""
  About OneStep-1 and OneStep-2 Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trials
  OneStep-1 and OneStep-2 were identical, double-blind, placebo-controlled
clinical trials conducted simultaneously that enrolled a total of 389
patients at 59 separate centers in the United States. The primary objective
was to establish the clinical superiority and safety of topical Locilex(R)
plus standard local wound care as compared to placebo cream plus standard
local wound care, in the treatment of Mild DFI. Patients were randomized 1:1
to receive either topical Locilex(R) plus standard local wound care or
placebo cream plus standard local wound care for 14 days, with final
evaluation at day 28. The primary endpoint of the trials is clinical
response, which is defined as infection resolved per the judgment of each
treating physician using the 2012 Infectious Disease Society of America
(IDSA) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of
Diabetic Foot Infections. Secondary endpoints include microbiological
success, which is defined as complete microbiological response, as well as
the incidence and severity of adverse events. Other endpoints include
several measurements with respect to the time and extent of wound healing.

Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:SGYP) today announced positive top-line results from the second of two pivotal phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of plecanatide, an investigational once-daily orally-administered compound, in 1,054 adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).

Preliminary analysis of the data indicates that both plecanatide 3 mg and 6 mg doses met the study’s primary endpoint and showed statistical significance in the percentage of patients who were Overall Responders compared to placebo during the 12-week treatment period (30.2% in 3 mg and 29.5% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 17.8% in placebo; p<0.001 for 3 mg and p<0.001 for 6 mg).

The most common adverse event was diarrhea which occurred in 5.4% of patients in 3 mg and 4.3% of patients in 6 mg dose groups compared to 0.6% of placebo-treated patients.

“We are understandably very pleased with these results, and how well the data support the first pivotal phase 3 IBS-C trial which we announced recently,” said Gary S. Jacob, Ph.D., Chairman and CEO of Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. “We have been relentless in our commitment to develop innovative treatments for the GI market. The successful phase 3 trials are a major step in our mission to better serve patients, as we believe plecanatide has the potential to be an important new treatment option for the millions of people suffering from IBS-C. I want to, in particular, acknowledge my colleagues at Synergy, my outstanding board, and the many stakeholders who have supported us throughout this clinical program.”

Ten patients in the trial (<1.0%) experienced serious adverse events but there was no imbalance across treatment groups in either incidences or individual serious adverse events. Overall, the rates of withdrawal from treatment because of an adverse event were low (2.6% in 3 mg and 2.3% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 0.8% in placebo) and discontinuations due to diarrhea were infrequent (1.7% in 3 mg and 1.2% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 0 in placebo).

Synergy reported positive top-line data in the first phase 3 IBS-C trial with plecanatide earlier this month. The company plans to present further clinical data from both trials at an appropriate scientific meeting next year.

Additionally, plecanatide is under review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is January 29, 2017. Pending approval in the CIC indication, the company plans to file a New Drug Application Supplement with Clinical Data (sNDA) for plecanatide in IBS-C in Q1 2017.

The Plecanatide Phase 3 IBS-C Program

Design

The plecanatide phase 3 IBS-C program includes two randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of plecanatide treatment (3 mg and 6 mg doses), taken as a tablet once-a-day in patients with IBS-C. Both trials included a two-week pre-treatment baseline period, a 12-week treatment period, and a two-week post-treatment follow-up period. The phase 3 IBS-C program was conducted in North America and designed to support regulatory submission in the U.S. Patients who were enrolled in these trials fulfilled Rome III IBS-C criteria related to abdominal pain and stool changes.

The first phase 3 IBS-C trial assessed 1,135 patients (28.2% males and 71.8% females) that were randomly assigned to take 3 mg or 6 mg plecanatide or placebo once-a-day during the 12-week treatment period (377 patients in the 3 mg dose group, 379 patients in the 6 mg dose group and 379 patients in the placebo group).

The second phase 3 IBS-C trial assessed 1,054 patients (23.6% males and 76.4% females) that were randomly assigned to take 3 mg or 6 mg plecanatide or placebo once-a-day during the 12-week treatment period (351 patients in the 3 mg dose group, 349 patients in the 6 mg dose group and 354 patients in the placebo group).

Primary Endpoint

The primary endpoint for both trials is the percentage of patients who are Overall Responders (%) during the 12-week treatment period. An Overall Responder, as defined by the FDA, is a patient who fulfills both ≥ 30% reduction in worst abdominal pain and an increase of ≥ 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) from baseline, in the same week, for at least 50% of the 12 treatment weeks. The Overall Responder endpoint is the current regulatory endpoint required for U.S. approval in IBS-C.

About Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C)

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and associated with 2 or more of the following: related to defecation, associated with a change in the frequency of stool, or associated with a change in the form (appearance) of the stool. IBS can be subtyped by the predominant stool form: constipation (IBS-C), diarrhea (IBS-D), or mixed (IBS-M). Those within the IBS-C subtype experience hard or lumpy stools more than 25 percent of the time they defecate, and loose or watery stools less than 25 percent of the time. It is estimated that the prevalence of IBS-C in the U.S. adult population is approximately 4 to 5 percent, although this number may vary as patients often fluctuate between the three subtypes of IBS.

About Plecanatide

Plecanatide is a peptide made up of 16 amino acids and, with the exception of a single amino acid substitution, it is identical to uroguanylin. Plecanatide is the first investigational drug designed to replicate the function of uroguanylin, a naturally occurring and endogenous human GI peptide which acts in a pH-sensitive manner targeting GC-C receptors primarily in the proximal small intestine. Plecanatide stimulates fluid secretion and promotes stool consistency necessary to support normal bowel function.

   -- Commenced data analysis of the Phase 3 Clinical Study of hGH-CTP in
      Growth Hormone Deficient Adults

   -- Initiated Global Pediatric Phase 3 Clinical Study of hGH-CTP in Growth
      Hormone Deficient Children
  MIAMI, Dec. 30, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OPKO Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPK)
announced it has commenced data analysis in the phase 3, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study of its investigational long-acting human growth
hormone product (hGH-CTP) in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD).
The multinational, multi-center study, which utilized a 2:1 randomization
between hGH-CTP and placebo, enrolled 203 subjects, 198 of whom received at
least one dose of study treatment.  Treatment was administered through a
weekly injection.
  On the primary endpoint of change in trunk fat mass from baseline to 26
weeks, there was no statistical difference between hGH-CTP and placebo.
However, after unblinding the study, OPKO identified one or more outliers
that may have affected the primary outcome.  As a result, OPKO is
undertaking further review of the study population as promptly as possible.
The safety profile observed in this study was consistent with that known for
growth hormone treatments.  A greater percentage of subjects on hGH-CTP
normalized serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I compared to
placebo.  Additional efficacy and safety data and analyses from the study
will be released once available.
  In addition to completing the Phase 3 adult GHD study, OPKO announces that
it has initiated a pivotal Phase 3 study this month in pre-pubertal growth
hormone deficient children to evaluate weekly treatment with hGH-CTP versus
daily injections of Genotropin. The hGH-CTP will be delivered in a pen
device in this multi-regional study.
  OPKO has a world-wide collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer Inc.
for the development and commercialization of hGH-CTP.  Under the agreement,
OPKO is responsible for conducting the clinical program and Pfizer is
responsible for registering and commercializing the product.

(NASDAQ:OPK) announced it has commenced data analysis in the phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of its investigational long-acting human growth hormone product (hGH-CTP) in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). The multinational, multi-center study, which utilized a 2:1 randomization between hGH-CTP and placebo, enrolled 203 subjects, 198 of whom received at least one dose of study treatment.  Treatment was administered through a weekly injection.   On the primary endpoint of change in trunk fat mass from baseline to 26 weeks, there was no statistical difference between hGH-CTP and placebo. However, after unblinding the study, OPKO identified one or more outliers that may have affected the primary outcome.  As a result, OPKO is undertaking further review of the study population as promptly as possible. The safety profile observed in this study was consistent with that known for growth hormone treatments.  A greater percentage of subjects on hGH-CTP normalized serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I compared to placebo.  Additional efficacy and safety data and analyses from the study will be released once available.   In addition to completing the Phase 3 adult GHD study, OPKO announces that it has initiated a pivotal Phase 3 study this month in pre-pubertal growth hormone deficient children to evaluate weekly treatment with hGH-CTP versus daily injections of Genotropin. The hGH-CTP will be delivered in a pen device in this multi-regional study.   OPKO has a world-wide collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer Inc. for the development and commercialization of hGH-CTP.  Under the agreement, OPKO is responsible for conducting the clinical program and Pfizer is responsible for registering and commercializing the product.   About OPKO Health, Inc.

Biclonics® retain the IgG format of antibodies that are produced naturally by the immune system and, by binding to two targets, enable multiple modes of action that cannot otherwise be obtained with conventional monoclonal antibodies. 

“By virtue of a unique ability to simultaneously engage multiple protein targets, we believe bispecific antibodies have the potential to play an important role in the future of biotherapeutics,” said Reid Huber, Ph.D., Incyte’s Chief Scientific Officer. “This collaboration with Merus expands our large molecule discovery capabilities into an innovation-rich area of research, creating additional opportunities for us to deliver on our commitment to improving and extending the lives of patients with cancer and other serious diseases.” 

“This transformative, global collaboration further underscores the potential of Merus’ Biclonics® technology platform and establishes a strong relationship with Incyte, a leader in innovative drug development,” said Ton Logtenberg, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Merus. “We look forward to expanding our pipeline under this agreement, as we efficiently exploit our preclinical discovery engine and progress our most advanced, proprietary assets in the clinic.” 

Terms of the Collaboration 

Under the terms of the collaboration, Incyte has agreed to pay Merus an upfront payment of $120 million. In addition, Incyte has agreed to purchase 3.2 million shares of Merus stock at $25 per share, for a total equity investment of $80 million. 

The parties have agreed to collaborate on the development and commercialization of up to 11 bispecific antibody programs. For one current preclinical program, Merus will retain all rights to develop and commercialize approved products in the United States, and Incyte will develop and commercialize approved products arising from the program outside the United States. Following any regulatory approval of a product candidate for this particular pre-clinical program, each company has agreed to pay the other tiered royalties ranging from 6 to 10 percent on net sales of products in their respective territories. 

Merus also has the option to co-fund development of product candidates arising from two other programs. For any program for which Merus exercises its co-development option, Merus would be responsible for 35 percent of global development costs in exchange for a 50 percent share of U.S. profits and losses and tiered royalties ranging from 6 to 10 percent on ex-U.S. sales by Incyte for these programs. Merus also has the right to elect to provide up to 50 percent of detailing activities for product candidates arising from one of these programs in the United States. 

For each of the other eight programs, Incyte has agreed to independently fund all development and commercialization activities. For these programs, Merus will be eligible to receive potential development, regulatory and sales milestone payments of up to $350 million per program, which could result in an aggregate milestone opportunity of approximately $2.8 billion if all development, regulatory and sales milestones are achieved across all such eight other programs in all territories. Merus will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from 6 to 10 percent on global sales of any approved products under these eight programs. 

Merus will retain rights to both of its clinical candidates and MCLA-158, as well as its technology platform and future programs emerging from Merus’ platform that are outside the scope of this agreement. 

The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to the early termination or expiration of any applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act and customary closing conditions.

  SAN DIEGO, Dec. 19, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc.
(NASDAQ:CNAT) today announced it has entered into an exclusive option,
collaboration and license agreement for the global development and
commercialization of its first-in-class, orally active pan-caspase inhibitor
emricasan with Novartis. Under the terms of the agreement with Novartis,
Conatus will receive $50 million upfront, and is eligible to receive $7
million following the exercise of the license option. Conatus can borrow up
to $15 million in the form of convertible promissory notes under an
investment agreement with Novartis.
  Conatus is eligible to receive significant payments if certain development,
regulatory and commercial milestones are met. Furthermore, Conatus is
eligible to receive tiered double digit royalties on emricasan single agent
sales and tiered single to double digit royalties on sales of combination
products containing emricasan. Conatus has the option to co-commercialize
emricasan in the United States, including combination therapies, on a

commitment to and expertise in liver disease, and proven record of success
in drug development provide our best opportunity to deliver these
potentially groundbreaking new therapies to chronic liver disease patients
with high unmet medical need.""
  ""For Conatus, the near-term infusion of capital and Phase 2b cost-sharing
allows us to fund ongoing operations through 2019. In addition, with the
Novartis commitment to fund Phase 3 single agent emricasan development and
all combination development activities, the resources are in place to
complete emricasan development both as a single agent for NASH cirrhosis and
as a single agent or part of a combination therapy for NASH fibrosis,"" added
Dr. Mento. ""The option to co-commercialize in the United States preserves
future flexibility for Conatus, and the ability to continue pursuing
independent development of other compounds affords us the opportunity to
build a portfolio of potential products to drive further long-term value for
our shareholders.""

  About Emricasan Clinical Development
  To date, emricasan has been studied in over 650 subjects in sixteen clinical
trials across a broad range of liver disease etiologies and stages of
progression. In multiple clinical trials, emricasan has demonstrated
statistically significant, rapid and sustained reductions in elevated levels
of key biomarkers of inflammation and apoptosis that are implicated in the
severity and progression of liver disease. Recent emricasan clinical trial
results have demonstrated emricasan's ability to provide statistically
significant improvements in clinically important validated surrogate
endpoints of portal hypertension and liver function across a variety of
etiologies in the subgroups of liver cirrhosis patients with highest medical
need. The parallel EmricasaN, a Caspase inhibitOR, for Evaluation (ENCORE)
clinical trials are designed to provide clinically relevant efficacy,
dosing, and safety data from chronic administration in patients with
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis and fibrosis to support the
design of Phase 3 efficacy and safety trials in these indications.
  The company is evaluating emricasan's potential effects on clinically
relevant consequences of NASH cirrhosis in its ongoing Phase 2b ENCORE-PH
(for Portal Hypertension) clinical trial with an HVPG portal hypertension
surrogate endpoint, initiated in November 2016, in patients with compensated
or early decompensated liver cirrhosis caused by NASH, and with severe
portal hypertension. The company is evaluating emricasan's potential
longer-term effects on liver structure in its ongoing Phase 2b ENCORE-NF
(for NASH Fibrosis) clinical trial with a histology-based endpoint,
initiated in January 2016, in patients with NASH fibrosis and its ongoing
Phase 2b POLT-HCV-SVR clinical trial with a histology-based endpoint,
initiated in May 2014, in post-orthotopic liver transplant (POLT) recipients
who have reestablished liver fibrosis or cirrhosis post-transplant as a
result of recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and who have
successfully achieved a sustained viral response (SVR) following antiviral
therapy. The planned Phase 2b ENCORE-LF (for Liver Function) clinical trial
with a composite clinical endpoint, expected to begin in the first half of
2017, will evaluate the effects of emricasan on liver function and collect
chronic administration safety information in decompensated NASH cirrhosis
patients. Conatus expects top-line results from its ongoing and planned
clinical trials to be available periodically beginning in the first half of
2018.
  About Conatus Pharmaceuticals

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) and Calithera Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq:CALA), a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule drugs directed against tumor metabolism and tumor immunology targets for the treatment of cancer, today announced a clinical trial collaboration to evaluate Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo in combination with Calithera’s CB-839 in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). CB-839 is an orally administered glutaminase inhibitor currently in Phase 1/2 clinical studies. 

Preclinical data suggest that CB-839, which is designed to target a pathway to starve tumor cells of the key nutrient glutamine, may enhance the effects of checkpoint inhibitors and may also reverse tumor resistance to checkpoint inhibitors by altering the immune-suppressive microenvironment and promoting an anti-tumor immune response. Opdivo is designed to overcome immune suppression. The companies will explore the potential of combining these two agents with the goal of achieving improved and sustained efficacy in ccRCC patients with cancer that is stable or growing on a PD-1 inhibitor therapy. 

“Influencing the tumor microenvironment remains a key area of focus of research, and we are excited to explore the potential benefits of Opdivo plus CB-839 in an effort to advance new combination therapies for difficult to treat cancers,” said Fouad Namouni, M.D., senior vice president, head of Oncology Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb. 

“The combination with Opdivo follows our strategy to combine CB-839 with therapies to improve outcomes for RCC patients,” said Susan Molineaux, CEO of Calithera Biosciences. “We believe that by blocking glutamine consumption in tumors, and redirecting this key nutrient for cell growth and proliferation to T-cells, CB-839 could enhance the effects of Opdivo. With support from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Calithera is excited to advance this combination into the Phase 2 portion of CX-839-004, our ongoing study in ccRCC patients.” 

Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world in July 2014, and currently has regulatory approval in 54 countries including the United States, Japan, and in the European Union. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb & Immuno-Oncology: Advancing Oncology Research 

At Bristol-Myers Squibb, we have a vision for the future of cancer care that is focused on Immuno-Oncology, now considered a major treatment choice alongside surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and targeted therapies for certain types of cancer. 

We have a comprehensive clinical portfolio of investigational and approved Immuno-Oncology agents, many of which were discovered and developed by our scientists. Our ongoing Immuno-Oncology clinical program is looking at broad patient populations, across multiple solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, and lines of therapy and histologies, with the intent of powering our trials for overall survival and other important measures like durability of response. We pioneered the research leading to the first regulatory approval for the combination of two Immuno-Oncology agents and continue to study the role of combinations in cancer. 

We are also investigating other immune system pathways in the treatment of cancer including CTLA-4, CD-137, KIR, SLAMF7, PD-1, GITR, CSF1R, IDO and LAG-3. These pathways may lead to potential new treatment options – in combination or monotherapy – to help patients fight different types of cancers. 

Our collaboration with academia, as well as small and large biotech and pharmaceutical companies, to research the potential of Immuno-Oncology and non-Immuno-Oncology combinations helps achieve our goal of providing new treatment options in clinical practice. 

At Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are committed to changing survival expectations in hard-to-treat cancers and the way patients live with cancer. 

About Opdivo 

Cancer cells may exploit “regulatory” pathways, such as checkpoint pathways, to hide from the immune system and shield the tumor from immune attack. Opdivo is a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor that binds to the checkpoint receptor PD-1 expressed on activated T-cells, and blocks the binding of PD-L1 and PD-L2, preventing the PD-1 pathway’s suppressive signaling on the immune system, including the interference with an anti-tumor immune response. 

Opdivo’s broad global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibb’s understanding of the biology behind Immuno-Oncology. Our company is at the forefront of researching the potential of Immuno-Oncology to extend survival in hard-to-treat cancers. This scientific expertise serves as the basis for the Opdivo development program, which includes a broad range of Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating overall survival as the primary endpoint across a variety of tumor types. The Opdivo trials have also contributed toward the clinical and scientific understanding of the role of biomarkers and how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has enrolled more than 18,000 patients.

In patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients. 

Complications of Allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO 

Complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who received allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO. Outcomes were evaluated in 17 patients from Checkmate 205 and 039, who underwent allogeneic HSCT after discontinuing OPDIVO (15 with reduced-intensity conditioning, 2 with myeloablative conditioning). Thirty-five percent (6/17) of patients died from complications of allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO. Five deaths occurred in the setting of severe or refractory GVHD. Grade 3 or higher acute GVHD was reported in 29% (5/17) of patients. Hyperacute GVHD was reported in 20% (n=2) of patients. A steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, without an identified infectious cause, was reported in 35% (n=6) of patients. Two cases of encephalitis were reported: Grade 3 (n=1) lymphocytic encephalitis without an identified infectious cause, and Grade 3 (n=1) suspected viral encephalitis. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) occurred in one patient, who received reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT and died of GVHD and multi-organ failure. Other cases of hepatic VOD after reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD have also been reported. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. 

Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. 

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity 

Based on their mechanisms of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an OPDIVO- or YERVOY- containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO. 

Lactation 

It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from an OPDIVO-containing regimen, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment. Advise women to discontinue nursing during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the final dose.

About Calithera Biosciences 

Calithera Biosciences, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule drugs directed against tumor metabolism and tumor immunology targets for the treatment of cancer. Calithera’s lead product candidate, CB-839, is a potent, selective, reversible and orally bioavailable inhibitor of glutaminase. CB-839 takes advantage of the pronounced dependency many cancers have on the nutrient glutamine for growth and survival. It is currently being evaluated in Phase 1/2 clinical trials in combination with standard of care agents. CB-1158 is a first-in-class immuno-oncology metabolic checkpoint inhibitor targeting arginase, a critical immunosuppressive enzyme responsible for T-cell suppression by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Arginase depletes arginine, a nutrient that is critical for the activation, growth and survival of the body’s cancer-fighting immune cells, known as cytotoxic T-cells. CB-1158 is currently in a Phase I clinical trial. Calithera is headquartered in South San Francisco, California. For more information about Calithera, please visit www.calithera.com. 
","Study to evaluate potential of CB-839 plus Opdivo to target immune-suppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) and Calithera Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq:CALA), a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule drugs directed against tumor metabolism and tumor immunology targets for the treatment of cancer, today announced a clinical trial collaboration to evaluate Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo in combination with Calithera’s CB-839 in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). CB-839 is an orally administered glutaminase inhibitor currently in Phase 1/2 clinical studies.   Preclinical data suggest that CB-839, which is designed to target a pathway to starve tumor cells of the key nutrient glutamine, may enhance the effects of checkpoint inhibitors and may also reverse tumor resistance to checkpoint inhibitors by altering the immune-suppressive microenvironment and promoting an anti-tumor immune response. Opdivo is designed to overcome immune suppression. The companies will explore the potential of combining these two agents with the goal of achieving improved and sustained efficacy in ccRCC patients with cancer that is stable or growing on a PD-1 inhibitor therapy.   “Influencing the tumor microenvironment remains a key area of focus of research, and we are excited to explore the potential benefits of Opdivo plus CB-839 in an effort to advance new combination therapies for difficult to treat cancers,” said Fouad Namouni, M.D., senior vice president, head of Oncology Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb.   “The combination with Opdivo follows our strategy to combine CB-839 with therapies to improve outcomes for RCC patients,” said Susan Molineaux, CEO of Calithera Biosciences. “We believe that by blocking glutamine consumption in tumors, and redirecting this key nutrient for cell growth and proliferation to T-cells, CB-839 could enhance the effects of Opdivo. With support from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Calithera is excited to advance this combination into the Phase 2 portion of CX-839-004, our ongoing study in ccRCC patients.”   Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world in July 2014, and currently has regulatory approval in 54 countries including the United States, Japan, and in the European Union.   Bristol-Myers Squibb & Immuno-Oncology: Advancing Oncology Research   At Bristol-Myers Squibb, we have a vision for the future of cancer care that is focused on Immuno-Oncology, now considered a major treatment choice alongside surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and targeted therapies for certain types of cancer.   We have a comprehensive clinical portfolio of investigational and approved Immuno-Oncology agents, many of which were discovered and developed by our scientists. Our ongoing Immuno-Oncology clinical program is looking at broad patient populations, across multiple solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, and lines of therapy and histologies, with the intent of powering our trials for overall survival and other important measures like durability of response. We pioneered the research leading to the first regulatory approval for the combination of two Immuno-Oncology agents and continue to study the role of combinations in cancer.   We are also investigating other immune system pathways in the treatment of cancer including CTLA-4, CD-137, KIR, SLAMF7, PD-1, GITR, CSF1R, IDO and LAG-3. These pathways may lead to potential new treatment options – in combination or monotherapy – to help patients fight different types of cancers.   Our collaboration with academia, as well as small and large biotech and pharmaceutical companies, to research the potential of Immuno-Oncology and non-Immuno-Oncology combinations helps achieve our goal of providing new treatment options in clinical practice.   At Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are committed to changing survival expectations in hard-to-treat cancers and the way patients live with cancer.   About Opdivo   Cancer cells may exploit “regulatory” pathways, such as checkpoint pathways, to hide from the immune system and shield the tumor from immune attack. Opdivo is a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor that binds to the checkpoint receptor PD-1 expressed on activated T-cells, and blocks the binding of PD-L1 and PD-L2, preventing the PD-1 pathway’s suppressive signaling on the immune system, including the interference with an anti-tumor immune response.   Opdivo’s broad global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibb’s understanding of the biology behind Immuno-Oncology. Our company is at the forefront of researching the potential of Immuno-Oncology to extend survival in hard-to-treat cancers. This scientific expertise serves as the basis for the Opdivo development program, which includes a broad range of Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating overall survival as the primary endpoint across a variety of tumor types. The Opdivo trials have also contributed toward the clinical and scientific understanding of the role of biomarkers and how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has enrolled more than 18,000 patients.   U.S. INDICATIONS & IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION   INDICATIONS   OPDIVO® (nivolumab) as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

Evaluation of patients with neurologic symptoms may include, but not be limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture. Withhold OPDIVO in patients with new-onset moderate to severe neurologic signs or symptoms and evaluate to rule out other causes. If other etiologies are ruled out, administer corticosteroids and permanently discontinue OPDIVO for immune-mediated encephalitis. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, encephalitis occurred in 0.2% (3/1994) of patients. Fatal limbic encephalitis occurred in one patient after 7.2 months of exposure despite discontinuation of OPDIVO and administration of corticosteroids. Encephalitis occurred in one patient receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY (0.2%) after 1.7 months of exposure.   Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions   Based on the severity of adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold treatment, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and, if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Across clinical trials of OPDIVO the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in <1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), myositis, myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, motor dysfunction, vasculitis, and myasthenic syndrome.   Infusion Reactions   OPDIVO can cause severe infusion reactions, which have been reported in <1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with Grade 1 or 2. In patients receiving OPDIVO monotherapy, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients.   Complications of Allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO   Complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who received allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO. Outcomes were evaluated in 17 patients from Checkmate 205 and 039, who underwent allogeneic HSCT after discontinuing OPDIVO (15 with reduced-intensity conditioning, 2 with myeloablative conditioning). Thirty-five percent (6/17) of patients died from complications of allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO. Five deaths occurred in the setting of severe or refractory GVHD. Grade 3 or higher acute GVHD was reported in 29% (5/17) of patients. Hyperacute GVHD was reported in 20% (n=2) of patients. A steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, without an identified infectious cause, was reported in 35% (n=6) of patients. Two cases of encephalitis were reported: Grade 3 (n=1) lymphocytic encephalitis without an identified infectious cause, and Grade 3 (n=1) suspected viral encephalitis. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) occurred in one patient, who received reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT and died of GVHD and multi-organ failure. Other cases of hepatic VOD after reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD have also been reported. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.   Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly.   Embryo-Fetal Toxicity   Based on their mechanisms of action, OPDIVO and YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an OPDIVO- or YERVOY- containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO.   Lactation   It is not known whether OPDIVO or YERVOY is present in human milk. Because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from an OPDIVO-containing regimen, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment. Advise women to discontinue nursing during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the final dose.   Serious Adverse Reactions   In Checkmate 037, serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO (n=268).

About Voclosporin
Voclosporin, an investigational drug, is a novel and potentially best-in-class calcineurin inhibitor (“CNI”) with clinical data in over 2,000 patients across indications. Voclosporin is an immunosuppressant, with a synergistic and dual mechanism of action that has the potential to improve near- and long-term outcomes in LN when added to standard of care (MMF). By inhibiting calcineurin, voclosporin blocks IL-2 expression and T-cell mediated immune responses. It is made by a modification of a single amino acid of the cyclosporine molecule which has shown a more predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship, an increase in potency, an altered metabolic profile, and potential for flat dosing. The Company anticipates that upon regulatory approval, patent protection for voclosporin will be extended in the United States and certain other major markets, including Europe and Japan, until at least October 2027 under the Hatch-Waxman Act and comparable laws in other countries. 

About Lupus Nephritis (LN)
Lupus Nephritis (LN) in an inflammation of the kidney caused by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and represents a serious progression of SLE. SLE is a chronic, complex and often disabling disorder and affects more than 500,000 people in the United States (mostly women). The disease is highly heterogeneous, affecting a wide range of organs & tissue systems. It is estimated that as many as 60% of all SLE patients have clinical LN requiring treatment. Unlike SLE, LN has straightforward disease outcomes where an early response correlates with long-term outcomes, measured by proteinuria. In patients with LN, renal damage results in proteinuria and/or hematuria and a decrease in renal function as evidenced by reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and increased serum creatinine levels. LN is debilitating and costly and if poorly controlled, LN can lead to permanent and irreversible tissue damage within the kidney, resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), thus making LN a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.

Further information can be found at www.lonza.com   About Voclosporin Voclosporin, an investigational drug, is a novel and potentially best-in-class calcineurin inhibitor (“CNI”) with clinical data in over 2,000 patients across indications. Voclosporin is an immunosuppressant, with a synergistic and dual mechanism of action that has the potential to improve near- and long-term outcomes in LN when added to standard of care (MMF). By inhibiting calcineurin, voclosporin blocks IL-2 expression and T-cell mediated immune responses. It is made by a modification of a single amino acid of the cyclosporine molecule which has shown a more predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship, an increase in potency, an altered metabolic profile, and potential for flat dosing. The Company anticipates that upon regulatory approval, patent protection for voclosporin will be extended in the United States and certain other major markets, including Europe and Japan, until at least October 2027 under the Hatch-Waxman Act and comparable laws in other countries.   About Lupus Nephritis (LN) Lupus Nephritis (LN) in an inflammation of the kidney caused by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and represents a serious progression of SLE.

to Include CCX140 to Treat Renal Diseases
  - ChemoCentryx to retain commercialization rights in the United States and
China, Vifor Pharma gains rights in all other markets -
  - ChemoCentryx to receive upfront cash commitment of USD 50 million plus
potential milestones and royalties -
  - Vifor Pharma receives an option to develop and commercialize CCX140 in
chronic kidney disease (CKD) with U.S. co-promotion rights retained by
ChemoCentryx -
  MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Dec. 22, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vifor Pharma, a
company of the Galenica Group, and ChemoCentryx, Inc., (Nasdaq:CCXI),
announced today the expansion of their existing kidney health alliance to
include the development and commercialization of CCX140, an
orally-administered inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2, for
renal diseases. CCX140 has previously completed a successful Phase II
clinical trial in patients with diabetic kidney disease.
  The alliance will initially focus on the joint development of CCX140 in rare
kidney diseases, with Vifor Pharma retaining an option to solely develop and
commercialize CCX140 in more prevalent forms of chronic kidney disease
(CKD). Under the agreement, ChemoCentryx retains marketing rights for rare
renal disease in the U.S. and China, while Vifor Pharma has
commercialization rights in the rest of the world.
  In May 2016, the two companies announced that Vifor Pharma had licensed
rights to commercialize CCX168 (international nonproprietary name:
avacopan), a Complement 5a Receptor (C5aR) inhibitor ready for Phase III
development for orphan and rare renal diseases, in Europe, Canada, Mexico,
Central and South America and South Korea.
  ""Expanding our kidney health alliance with Vifor Pharma to include CCX140 is
an important step in our vision to establish ChemoCentryx as a leader in new
medicines for rare renal diseases,"" said Thomas J. Schall, Ph.D., President
and CEO of ChemoCentryx. ""We and Vifor Pharma believe that CCX140 has the
potential to address life threatening renal diseases for which there are
currently very limited treatment options. Building upon the extremely
productive relationship with our partner so far, we very much look forward
to expanding that relationship with this unique clinical asset.""
  ""The expansion of our partnership with ChemoCentryx demonstrates Vifor
Pharma's commitment to remain at the forefront of new treatments for
patients with renal diseases,"" said Gianni Zampieri, CEO of Vifor Pharma.
""CCX140 is a highly innovative approach, which is implicated in a number of
kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy. We look forward to working
with ChemoCentryx to develop both CCX140 and the C5aR inhibitor avacopan as
potential new treatment options for patients suffering from serious kidney
diseases.""
  Under the terms of the agreement, ChemoCentryx will receive an upfront cash
payment of USD 50 million. In addition, ChemoCentryx will be eligible to
receive additional payments upon the achievement of certain development,
regulatory and sales-based milestones, as well as tiered double-digit
royalties on net sales of CCX140 in the licensed territories.
  ChemoCentryx will be responsible for the clinical development of CCX140 in
rare renal diseases, while sharing the cost of such development with Vifor
Pharma. Should Vifor Pharma later exercise the CKD option, Vifor Pharma
would then be responsible for all development and would receive worldwide
rights to CCX140, while ChemoCentryx would receive co-promotion rights in
CKD in the U.S.
  CCX140 targets the chemokine receptor known as CCR2 and has successfully
completed a Phase II clinical trial in patients with diabetic nephropathy
where it was shown to be safe and well tolerated while demonstrating
statistically significant improvements in kidney function. CCR2 is found on
subsets of monocytes and macrophages, which are cells of the immune system
believed to play an important role in inflammatory processes. Blocking CCR2
is intended to reduce the abnormal monocyte- and macrophage-driven
inflammatory response implicated in renal diseases such as diabetic
nephropathy. CCR2 may also have a direct role in the function of other
specialized cells in the kidney, where its inhibition would correlate with a
positive therapeutic effect.
  ChemoCentryx, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on
discovering, developing and commercializing orally-administered therapeutics
that target the chemokine and chemoattractant systems in order to treat
autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer. The chemokine system
is a biological network that regulates inflammation via a collection of
secreted chemokine molecules, or ligands, and their specific cell surface
receptors. Based on its proprietary drug discovery and drug development
platform, ChemoCentryx has generated multiple clinical and preclinical-stage
programs, each targeting distinct chemokine and chemoattractant receptors
with different small molecule compounds. Avacopan (CCX168), a C5aR
inhibitor, has successfully completed Phase II development for the treatment
of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic auto-antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV).
Avacopan appears to be safe, well tolerated and successful in allowing
reduction and elimination of high-dose steroids, part of standard of care
for AAV patients, while providing effective control of the disease in
clinical studies to date. Avacopan is also in Phase II studies for the
treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and immunoglobulin A
nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy (IgAN). ChemoCentryx has licensed exclusive
rights to Vifor Pharma to commercialize avacopan in Europe and certain other
markets outside of the U.S. and most of Asia. CCX872, a CCR2 inhibitor,
successfully completed Phase I development and is in development for the
treatment of non-resectable pancreatic cancer. CCX140, a distinct CCR2
inhibitor, successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial where it was
shown to be safe and well tolerated while demonstrating statistically
significant improvement in albuminuria in patients with diabetic
nephropathy. ChemoCentryx has licensed exclusive rights to Vifor Pharma to
commercialize CCX140 in markets outside of the U.S. and China. Other
clinical programs include CCX507, a next generation CCR9 inhibitor, which
has successfully completed Phase I development, vercirnon (also known as
Traficet-EN or CCX282) a specific CCR9 inhibitor for the treatment of
inflammatory bowel disease, and CCX354, a CCR1 inhibitor which successfully
completed a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis. ChemoCentryx also has several programs in advanced preclinical
development.

CCX140 has previously completed a successful Phase II clinical trial in patients with diabetic kidney disease.   The alliance will initially focus on the joint development of CCX140 in rare kidney diseases, with Vifor Pharma retaining an option to solely develop and commercialize CCX140 in more prevalent forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Under the agreement, ChemoCentryx retains marketing rights for rare renal disease in the U.S. and China, while Vifor Pharma has commercialization rights in the rest of the world.   In May 2016, the two companies announced that Vifor Pharma had licensed rights to commercialize CCX168 (international nonproprietary name: avacopan), a Complement 5a Receptor (C5aR) inhibitor ready for Phase III development for orphan and rare renal diseases, in Europe, Canada, Mexico, Central and South America and South Korea.   ""Expanding our kidney health alliance with Vifor Pharma to include CCX140 is an important step in our vision to establish ChemoCentryx as a leader in new medicines for rare renal diseases,"" said Thomas J. Schall, Ph.D., President and CEO of ChemoCentryx. ""We and Vifor Pharma believe that CCX140 has the potential to address life threatening renal diseases for which there are currently very limited treatment options. Building upon the extremely productive relationship with our partner so far, we very much look forward to expanding that relationship with this unique clinical asset.""   ""The expansion of our partnership with ChemoCentryx demonstrates Vifor Pharma's commitment to remain at the forefront of new treatments for patients with renal diseases,"" said Gianni Zampieri, CEO of Vifor Pharma. ""CCX140 is a highly innovative approach, which is implicated in a number of kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy. We look forward to working with ChemoCentryx to develop both CCX140 and the C5aR inhibitor avacopan as potential new treatment options for patients suffering from serious kidney diseases.""   Under the terms of the agreement, ChemoCentryx will receive an upfront cash payment of USD 50 million. In addition, ChemoCentryx will be eligible to receive additional payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, as well as tiered double-digit royalties on net sales of CCX140 in the licensed territories.   ChemoCentryx will be responsible for the clinical development of CCX140 in rare renal diseases, while sharing the cost of such development with Vifor Pharma. Should Vifor Pharma later exercise the CKD option, Vifor Pharma would then be responsible for all development and would receive worldwide rights to CCX140, while ChemoCentryx would receive co-promotion rights in CKD in the U.S.   CCX140 targets the chemokine receptor known as CCR2 and has successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial in patients with diabetic nephropathy where it was shown to be safe and well tolerated while demonstrating statistically significant improvements in kidney function. CCR2 is found on subsets of monocytes and macrophages, which are cells of the immune system believed to play an important role in inflammatory processes. Blocking CCR2 is intended to reduce the abnormal monocyte- and macrophage-driven inflammatory response implicated in renal diseases such as diabetic nephropathy. CCR2 may also have a direct role in the function of other specialized cells in the kidney, where its inhibition would correlate with a positive therapeutic effect.

Mid-Cycle Communication Meeting with FDA completed
Additional clinical information for 500mg and 625mg BID dose groups to be provided by the Company today
Clovis Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLVS) today announced that during its regularly scheduled Mid-Cycle Communication Meeting held last week with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the agency requested additional clinical data for use in the efficacy analysis for both the 500mg and 625mg BID dose patient groups for rociletinib. The Company will provide this information in a Major Amendment to the FDA by close of business today.

“We remain confident in rociletinib and its potential to treat patients with mutant EGFR T790M-positive lung cancer, said Patrick J. Mahaffy, President and CEO of Clovis Oncology. “We will continue to work diligently with the FDA on our NDA submission.”

In the Mid-Cycle Communication meeting, the FDA emphasized that its efficacy analysis would focus solely on confirmed responses. The New Drug Application (NDA) submitted by Clovis to the FDA contained immature data sets based on both unconfirmed response rates and confirmed response rates. These data sets were updated in the 90 day efficacy update the Company submitted at the end of October.

As the rociletinib clinical trials were rapidly enrolling, Clovis presented interim data publicly and at medical meetings and these data therefore included a data set based primarily on unconfirmed responses. This was also true of the Company’s Breakthrough Therapy designation submission. In the Company’s NDA submission, both immature confirmed and unconfirmed response analyses were submitted. As the efficacy data have matured, the number of patients with an unconfirmed response who converted to a confirmed response was lower than expected.

In the intent to treat analysis of the 79 patients in the 500mg dose group, the current confirmed response rate is 28 percent, and 34 percent in the 170 patients in the 625mg dose group, with an encouraging duration of response in both doses. The most frequent reasons that patients’ responses were not confirmed in a subsequent scan were due to progression, often due to brain metastasis, and due to subsequent scans not demonstrating tumor shrinkage greater than 30 percent.

The Company anticipates that the review of this additional information will result in a delay of a potential approval. This additional review could lead to an extension of the Company’s March 30, 2016 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date.

Conference Call Details
Clovis will hold a conference call to discuss this regulatory update later this morning, November 16, at 8:30am ET. The conference call will be simultaneously webcast on the Company’s web site at www.clovisoncology.com, and archived for future review.

(NASDAQ: PTCT) today announced that it received yesterday evening a Refuse to File letter from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding PTC's New Drug Application (NDA) for Translarna™ (ataluren), an oral, first-in-class, protein restoration therapy for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD).

The FDA states in the Refuse to File letter that the application was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.  PTC first learned of the Refuse to File decision via this letter and is reviewing its content to determine the appropriate next steps.     

About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  
Primarily affecting males, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle disorder caused by the lack of functional dystrophin protein. Dystrophin is critical to the structural stability of skeletal, diaphragm, and heart muscles. Patients with DMD lose the ability to walk as early as age 10 and experience life-threatening lung and heart complications in their late teens and twenties. It is estimated that nonsense mutations account for approximately 13% of DMD cases, or approximately 2,000 patients in the United States.

About Translarna™ (ataluren)   
Translarna, discovered and developed by PTC Therapeutics, Inc., is a protein restoration therapy designed to enable the formation of a functioning protein in patients with genetic disorders caused by a nonsense mutation. A nonsense mutation is an alteration in the genetic code that prematurely halts the synthesis of an essential protein. The resulting disorder is determined by which protein cannot be expressed in its entirety and is no longer functional, such as dystrophin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Translarna is licensed in the European Economic Area for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. Translarna is an investigational new drug in the United States. The development of Translarna has been supported by grants from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Inc. (the nonprofit affiliate of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation); Muscular Dystrophy Association; FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development; National Center for Research Resources; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy.

About T790M-Positive Mutant EGFR NSCLC

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the United States, with more than 200,000 new cases each year, and is the leading cause of cancer-related death. NSCLC accounts for almost 85 percent of lung cancers, and the five-year survival rate in locally advanced and metastatic patients is 27 and four percent, respectively.

Approximately 10-15 percent of patients with NSCLC in the United States have the EGFR mutation. While the majority of these patients will respond to treatment with first- or second-generation EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), most patients will eventually develop acquired resistance to these therapies, predominantly due to the primary resistance mutation, T790M.

intend to submit the NDA in the fourth quarter of this year.""
  About Zilretta
  Zilretta is being investigated as the first intra-articular
sustained-release, non-opioid treatment for patients with moderate to severe
knee OA pain. Zilretta employs proprietary microsphere technology combining
TCA -- a commonly administered, short-acting corticosteroid -- with a
polymer (PLGA) intended to provide persistent concentrations of drug locally
to both amplify the magnitude and prolong the duration of pain relief.
  To date, more than 600 patients have been treated with Zilretta in clinical
trials. No drug-related serious adverse events have been observed in these
trials and adverse events have typically been localized, mild and comparable
to those observed with immediate-release TCA and placebo. The data from
these trials are consistent with Zilretta providing meaningful and durable
pain relief.

We intend to submit the NDA in the fourth quarter of this year.""   About Zilretta   Zilretta is being investigated as the first intra-articular sustained-release, non-opioid treatment for patients with moderate to severe knee OA pain. Zilretta employs proprietary microsphere technology combining TCA -- a commonly administered, short-acting corticosteroid -- with a polymer (PLGA) intended to provide persistent concentrations of drug locally to both amplify the magnitude and prolong the duration of pain relief.   To date, more than 600 patients have been treated with Zilretta in clinical trials. No drug-related serious adverse events have been observed in these trials and adverse events have typically been localized, mild and comparable to those observed with immediate-release TCA and placebo. The data from these trials are consistent with Zilretta providing meaningful and durable pain relief.   About Flexion Therapeutics   Flexion is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel, local therapies for the treatment of patients with musculoskeletal conditions, beginning with OA. The company's lead product candidate, Zilretta, is being investigated for its potential to provide improved analgesic therapy for the millions of U.S. patients who receive IA injections for knee OA annually.",,40%

  SALT LAKE CITY, June 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lipocine Inc.
(NASDAQ:LPCN), a specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced that it
has received a Complete Response Letter (""CRL"") from the United States Food
and Drug Administration (""FDA"") regarding its New Drug Application (""NDA"")
for LPCN 1021, an oral testosterone product candidate for testosterone
replacement therapy (""TRT"") in adult males for conditions associated with a
deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone, also known as
hypogonadism. A CRL is a communication from the FDA that informs companies
that an application cannot be approved in its present form.
  The CRL identified deficiencies related to the dosing algorithm for the
label.  Specifically, the proposed titration scheme for clinical practice
was significantly different from the titration scheme used in the Phase 3
trial leading to discordance in titration decisions between the Phase 3
trial and real-world clinical practice.
  The next step will be to request a meeting with the FDA to understand more
fully the issues raised and to agree on a path forward to achieve approval
of LPCN 1021.
  ""We are evaluating the content of the CRL, including the FDA recommended
actions to bring our NDA in a position for approval, and will work closely
with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps for the NDA.  We remain
committed to bringing LPCN 1021 to patients who will benefit from its
intended use,"" said Dr. Mahesh Patel, Chairman, President and CEO of
Lipocine. ""We continue to believe that LPCN 1021 has the potential to
improve the ease of use compared to the available formulations, including
topical gels and injections, and to overcome inadvertent testosterone
transference risk to children and partners that exist with topical gels.
  About LPCN 1021
  LPCN 1021 is a novel twice-a-day oral testosterone replacement therapy
product candidate that is designed to help restore normal testosterone
levels in hypogonadal men. Lipocine expects LPCN 1021 will help fulfill an
unmet need in the treatment of hypogonadism. The current testosterone market
primarily uses short-acting injectable products as well as topical products
that carry an FDA ""black box"" warning related to inadvertent transfer of
testosterone to others. According to the IMS Health database, an average of
half a million prescriptions a month have been dispensed so far in 2016 for
TRT.

Fast Track Designation
  Company Also Provides Update On New Interim Analysis From Phase 1b Study
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 01, 2016--
  Today Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) announced that aducanumab, its investigational
treatment for early Alzheimer's disease (AD), was granted Fast Track
designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA's Fast
Track program supports the development of new treatments for serious
conditions with an unmet medical need such as Alzheimer's disease.
  ""By collaborating with regulators through programs like Fast Track, we hope
to bring effective treatments to patients and families affected by
Alzheimer's disease as quickly as possible,"" said Alfred Sandrock, M.D.,
Ph.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer at Biogen.
  Aducanumab is currently being evaluated in two global Phase 3 studies,
ENGAGE and EMERGE, which are designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy in
slowing cognitive impairment and the progression of disability in people
with early Alzheimer's disease.
  For more information about the Phase 3 studies, including information about
participating centers, visit www.ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02477800 or
NCT02484547).
  Update: Phase 1b Data
  PRIME is the ongoing Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multiple-dose study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
(PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and clinical effects of aducanumab in patients
with prodromal or mild AD.
  The placebo-controlled portion of the study included fixed doses of
aducanumab at 1, 3, 6 and 10 mg/kg and a titration regimen. PRIME also has a
long-term extension for patients who completed the one-year
placebo-controlled portion of the study.
  In a recently completed interim analysis from PRIME, efficacy and safety
data were consistent with results previously reported. These data support
the design of the ongoing Phase 3 ENGAGE and EMERGE studies. Biogen plans to
share detailed information about these results at upcoming medical meetings.


  About Aducanumab
  Aducanumab (BIIB037) is an investigational compound being developed for the
treatment of early AD. Aducanumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody
(mAb) derived from a de-identified library of B cells collected from healthy
elderly subjects with no signs of cognitive impairment or cognitively
impaired elderly subjects with unusually slow cognitive decline using
Neurimmune's technology platform called Reverse Translational Medicine
(RTM). Biogen licensed aducanumab from Neurimmune under a collaborative
development and license agreement.
  Aducanumab is thought to target aggregated forms of beta amyloid including
soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils deposited into the amyloid plaque in
the brain of AD patients. Based on pre-clinical and interim Phase 1b data,
treatment with aducanumab has been shown to reduce amyloid plaque levels.
  About Alzheimer's Disease
  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder
characterized by cognitive decline and behavioral disturbances that
eventually result in a person's inability to perform daily activities. In
2010, it was estimated that 25 million individuals were living with AD
worldwide(1) . Evidence suggests that pathophysiological changes typically
begin years prior to the symptoms that lead to a clinical diagnosis. As the
disease progresses, cognitive impairments, behavioral changes and functional
disability commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.

  PR Newswire
  SOUTH PLAINFIELD, N.J., Oct. 17, 2016
  SOUTH PLAINFIELD, N.J., Oct. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- PTC Therapeutics, Inc.
(NASDAQ: PTCT) today provided a regulatory update on Translarna(TM)
(ataluren) for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (nmDMD).
  U.S. regulatory update
  PTC Therapeutics announced today that at the end of last week, the Office of
Drug Evaluation I (ODE-I) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
denied the company's first appeal of the refuse to file letter issued by the
FDA's Division of Neurological Products (DNP) on February 22, 2016 regarding
PTC's New Drug Application (NDA) for Translarna for the treatment of
nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD).
  The company intends to escalate its appeal to the next supervisory level of
the FDA. This is an iterative process and the company anticipates that
multiple cycles of appeals to progressively higher levels of the FDA may be
required.
  PTC continues to assert that a proper assessment of the data and analyses
from multiple clinical studies, including two of the largest
placebo-controlled trials ever conducted in DMD, can only be accomplished in
the context of a full and fair review by the FDA. This would include an
advisory committee meeting that allows clinical experts and representatives
of the patient community to express their views on Translarna for the
treatment of nmDMD. The company believes that Translarna is the only therapy
in clinical development designed to target the underlying cause of nmDMD. In
addition, a favorable safety profile has been consistently demonstrated in
PTC's clinical trials, which have enrolled over 1,000 individuals to date.
  ""We believe that fair consideration of the totality of Translarna's data
requires a full review of our application by the FDA,"" said Stuart W. Peltz,
Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, PTC Therapeutics, Inc. ""In light of this,
continuing the formal dispute resolution process reflects our ongoing
commitment to work with regulators and the Duchenne community to make
Translarna available to nmDMD patients in the United States.""
  In addition, the company maintains its position that PTC should, under
existing law and in fairness to patients, be provided the same opportunity
for full review that the DNP gave to other recent applicants for products in
development for different subsets of the DMD population.
  ""I am disappointed that a treatment for patients with nonsense mutation DMD
is still not receiving a fair opportunity in front of the FDA,"" said Pat
Furlong, President and Founder of Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy. ""This
inconsistency is unacceptable and is concerning for the entire community.
This devastating, muscle-wasting disease cuts short the lives of boys and
young men and every day that we wait for treatments, is a day in which
muscle function is lost and not regained. As a community, we cannot rest
until there are treatments for all the boys and young men.""
  European regulatory update
  PTC recently participated in an oral explanation meeting before the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)
in connection with the company's ongoing annual renewal of its marketing
authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory
patients aged five years and older. The marketing authorization in the
European Economic Area (EEA), originally granted in August 2014, is subject
to an annual renewal process, including an assessment by European regulators
of a risk-benefit profile in favor of Translarna authorization.
  Following conclusion of the recent oral explanation, the CHMP issued a
request for supplemental information (RSI), including a request categorized
as a major objection. Generally speaking, renewal of a marketing
authorization requires a company to adequately address the points raised in
a major objection. As with prior RSIs received by the company during this
renewal process, the major objection relates to the efficacy and overall
risk-benefit profile of Translarna as well as the design and conduct of an
additional clinical trial that would provide comprehensive clinical data.
The RSIs also include requests categorized as other concerns, which do not
rise to the level of a major objection, and are generally associated with
the primary pharmacology of Translarna and label matters.
  The company continues to believe that if the CHMP issues a positive opinion
in favor of the renewal of Translarna's marketing authorization, such
renewal, and any subsequent annual renewals, will be coupled with an
obligation to conduct an agreed upon new clinical trial of Translarna for
the treatment of nmDMD. The EMA could also impose other new conditions to
the authorization for renewal or make other recommendations, including the
potential withdrawal of the marketing authorization.
  PTC anticipates that an opinion regarding its marketing authorization
renewal request will be adopted by the CHMP before the end of 2016. The
company expects that its current marketing authorization will remain valid
while the EMA's assessment is ongoing and until it is concluded with a
decision from the European Commission.
  About Translarna(TM) (ataluren)
  Translarna, discovered and developed by PTC Therapeutics, Inc., is a protein
restoration therapy designed to enable the formation of a functioning
protein in patients with genetic disorders caused by a nonsense mutation. A
nonsense mutation is an alteration in the genetic code that prematurely
halts the synthesis of an essential protein. The resulting disorder is
determined by which protein cannot be expressed in its entirety and is no
longer functional, such as dystrophin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Translarna is licensed in the European Economic Area for the treatment of
nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy in ambulatory patients aged
five years and older. Translarna is an investigational new drug in the
United States. The development of Translarna has been supported by grants
from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Inc. (the nonprofit affiliate
of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation); Muscular Dystrophy Association; FDA's
Office of Orphan Products Development; National Center for Research
Resources; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and Parent Project
Muscular Dystrophy.
  About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
  Primarily affecting males, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a
progressive muscle disorder caused by the lack of functional dystrophin
protein. Dystrophin is critical to the structural stability of skeletal,
diaphragm, and heart muscles. Patients with DMD, the more severe form of the
disorder, lose the ability to walk as early as age 10 and experience
life-threatening lung and heart complications in their late teens and
twenties. It is estimated that a nonsense mutation is the cause of DMD in
approximately 13 per cent of patients.
  About PTC Therapeutics
  PTC is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery,
development and commercialization of orally administered, proprietary small

regulatory events that occur in cells during and after a messenger RNA, or
mRNA, molecule is copied from DNA through the transcription process. PTC's
internally discovered pipeline addresses multiple therapeutic areas,
including rare disorders and oncology. PTC has discovered all of its
compounds currently under development using its proprietary technologies.
PTC plans to continue to develop these compounds both on its own and through
selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical and

(NASDAQ: PTCT) today provided a regulatory update on Translarna(TM) (ataluren) for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD).   U.S. regulatory update   PTC Therapeutics announced today that at the end of last week, the Office of Drug Evaluation I (ODE-I) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) denied the company's first appeal of the refuse to file letter issued by the FDA's Division of Neurological Products (DNP) on February 22, 2016 regarding PTC's New Drug Application (NDA) for Translarna for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD).   The company intends to escalate its appeal to the next supervisory level of the FDA. This is an iterative process and the company anticipates that multiple cycles of appeals to progressively higher levels of the FDA may be required.   PTC continues to assert that a proper assessment of the data and analyses from multiple clinical studies, including two of the largest placebo-controlled trials ever conducted in DMD, can only be accomplished in the context of a full and fair review by the FDA. This would include an advisory committee meeting that allows clinical experts and representatives of the patient community to express their views on Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. The company believes that Translarna is the only therapy in clinical development designed to target the underlying cause of nmDMD. In addition, a favorable safety profile has been consistently demonstrated in PTC's clinical trials, which have enrolled over 1,000 individuals to date.   ""We believe that fair consideration of the totality of Translarna's data requires a full review of our application by the FDA,"" said Stuart W. Peltz, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, PTC Therapeutics, Inc. ""In light of this, continuing the formal dispute resolution process reflects our ongoing commitment to work with regulators and the Duchenne community to make Translarna available to nmDMD patients in the United States.""   In addition, the company maintains its position that PTC should, under existing law and in fairness to patients, be provided the same opportunity for full review that the DNP gave to other recent applicants for products in development for different subsets of the DMD population.   ""I am disappointed that a treatment for patients with nonsense mutation DMD is still not receiving a fair opportunity in front of the FDA,"" said Pat Furlong, President and Founder of Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy. ""This inconsistency is unacceptable and is concerning for the entire community. This devastating, muscle-wasting disease cuts short the lives of boys and young men and every day that we wait for treatments, is a day in which muscle function is lost and not regained. As a community, we cannot rest until there are treatments for all the boys and young men.""   European regulatory update   PTC recently participated in an oral explanation meeting before the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in connection with the company's ongoing annual renewal of its marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. The marketing authorization in the European Economic Area (EEA), originally granted in August 2014, is subject to an annual renewal process, including an assessment by European regulators of a risk-benefit profile in favor of Translarna authorization.   Following conclusion of the recent oral explanation, the CHMP issued a request for supplemental information (RSI), including a request categorized as a major objection. Generally speaking, renewal of a marketing authorization requires a company to adequately address the points raised in a major objection. As with prior RSIs received by the company during this renewal process, the major objection relates to the efficacy and overall risk-benefit profile of Translarna as well as the design and conduct of an additional clinical trial that would provide comprehensive clinical data. The RSIs also include requests categorized as other concerns, which do not rise to the level of a major objection, and are generally associated with the primary pharmacology of Translarna and label matters.   The company continues to believe that if the CHMP issues a positive opinion in favor of the renewal of Translarna's marketing authorization, such renewal, and any subsequent annual renewals, will be coupled with an obligation to conduct an agreed upon new clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. The EMA could also impose other new conditions to the authorization for renewal or make other recommendations, including the potential withdrawal of the marketing authorization.   PTC anticipates that an opinion regarding its marketing authorization renewal request will be adopted by the CHMP before the end of 2016. The company expects that its current marketing authorization will remain valid while the EMA's assessment is ongoing and until it is concluded with a decision from the European Commission.

  Auryxia is now available for prescription in the U.S.
  BOSTON, Nov. 09, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.
(Nasdaq:KERX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on bringing innovative
medicines to people with renal disease, today announced that the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its application for a second drug
product contract manufacturer. Patheon Manufacturing Services LLC of
Greenville, North Carolina, a leading global provider of pharmaceutical
manufacturing services, is now an FDA approved drug product manufacturer of
Auryxia(R). With FDA approval of this manufacturer, the company has rebuilt
supply and will promptly make Auryxia available to wholesalers.
  ""We are pleased with today's approval, as it expands our manufacturing
capabilities and capacity,"" said Greg Madison, president and chief executive
officer of Keryx Biopharmaceuticals. ""Getting a second drug product
manufacturer approved was an important step to ensuring long-term supply of

  About Auryxia(R)
  Auryxia (ferric citrate) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration on September 5, 2014 and is indicated in the U.S. for the
control of serum phosphorus levels in patients with CKD on dialysis. The
U.S. approval of Auryxia was based on data from the company's Phase 3
registration program. In the Phase 3 clinical trials, Auryxia effectively
reduced serum phosphorus levels to within the KDOQI guidelines range of 3.5
to 5.5 mg/dL.
  Auryxia binds with dietary phosphate in the GI tract and precipitates as
ferric phosphate. The unbound portion of Auryxia has been shown to increase
serum iron parameters including ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT).
Iron absorption from Auryxia may lead to excessive elevations in iron
stores. Accordingly, physicians should assess and monitor iron parameters
before starting and while on Auryxia, and may need to decrease or
discontinue IV iron for these patients. The most common adverse events for
Auryxia treated patients were gastrointestinal related, including diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting and constipation. For more information about Auryxia and
the U.S. full prescribing information, visit www.Auryxia.com.
  IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATION FOR AURYXIA(R) (ferric citrate)
  Contraindication: Patients with iron overload syndrome, e.g.
hemochromatosis, should not take Auryxia(R).
  Iron Overload: Iron absorption from Auryxia may lead to increased iron in
storage sites. Iron parameters should be monitored prior to and while on
Auryxia. Patients receiving IV iron may require a reduction in dose or
discontinuation of IV iron therapy.
  Accidental Overdose of Iron: Accidental overdose of iron containing products
is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 years of age. Keep
Auryxia away from children as it contains iron. Call a poison control center
or your physician in case of an accidental overdose in a child.
  Patients with Gastrointestinal Bleeding or Inflammation: Safety has not been
established for these patients.
  Adverse Events: The most common adverse events with Auryxia were diarrhea
(21%), nausea (11%), constipation (8%), vomiting (7%) and cough (6%).
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions were the most common reason for
discontinuing Auryxia (14%). Auryxia contains iron and may cause dark
stools, which is considered normal with oral medications containing iron.
  Drug Interactions: Doxycycline should be taken at least 1 hour before
Auryxia. Ciprofloxacin should be taken at least 2 hours before or after
Auryxia.

DVAX,11/14/16,Biotech,Regulatory,MarketWired,S.IW DVAX .NASDAQ PBBI.IW .PHARMA PBDR.IW PBTR.IW CC.IW .CC CC.IW,Dynavax Receives Complete Response Letter from U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Biologics License Application for HEPLISAV-B,"BERKELEY, CA--(Marketwired - November 14, 2016) - Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: DVAX) today announced that it has received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding its Biologics License Application (BLA) for HEPLISAV-B™ [Hepatitis B Vaccine, Recombinant (Adjuvanted)] for immunization of adults 18 years and older against hepatitis B infection. The FDA issues CRLs to communicate that the Agency has completed a review cycle of an application and to request additional information for review and approval. Dynavax expects a Class 2 designation for a resubmission of the BLA, which would result in a target review period of six months.

The CRL seeks information regarding several topics, including clarification regarding specific adverse events of special interest (AESIs), a numerical imbalance in a small number of cardiac events in a single study (HBV-23), new analyses of the integrated safety data base across different time periods, and post-marketing commitments. In the CRL, the FDA acknowledged that it has not yet completed its review of responses received from Dynavax in early October, including those pertaining to AESIs and the numerical imbalance in cardiac events. The responses included an extensive analysis that included independent expert consultation supporting our view that the imbalance was driven by an unexpectedly low number of events in the comparator arm. It would appear the Agency could not fully assess the responses in the current review period. In the CRL, there is no request for additional clinical trials and there are no apparent concerns with rare serious autoimmune events.

""The CRL is consistent with our opinion that HEPLISAV-B is approvable and we are seeking to meet with the FDA as soon as possible,"" said Eddie Gray, chief executive officer of Dynavax. ""However, the time and resources that will be required to gain approval leads us to consider that we may not be able to advance this program on our own and we are moving swiftly to identify a potential pharmaceutical or financial partner. We will maintain our efforts on the oncology programs, including our lead cancer immunotherapy candidate, SD-101, for which we recently announced encouraging early clinical data in metastatic melanoma.""

Conference Call Details 
The Dynavax management team will host a conference call and webcast today, Monday, November 14, 2016, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, to provide more information about the CRL. The live call can be accessed by phone by dialing (877) 479-1857 (domestic) or +1 (503) 343-6309 (international) and specifying conference call code 19882810.

A replay of the conference call may be accessed for one week following the call by dialing (855) 859-2056 (domestic) or +1 (404) 537-3406, and the passcode is 19882810.

About Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B is a viral disease of the liver that can become chronic and can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. In the United States, the CDC estimates that approximately 20,000 hepatitis B infections continue to occur annually,(i) with the vast majority occurring in adults. There is no cure for hepatitis B, and disease prevention through effective vaccination is critical to reducing the spread of the disease. Currently marketed hepatitis B vaccines are administered in three doses over a six-month schedule. Results of a published Vaccine Safety Datalink study showed that 54 percent of adults completed the currently available three-dose hepatitis B vaccine series in one year. Those who do not complete the series may not be adequately protected against hepatitis B.

About HEPLISAV-B
HEPLISAV-B is an investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine that combines hepatitis B surface antigen with a proprietary Toll-like receptor 9 agonist to enhance the immune response. HEPLISAV-B is administered in two doses over one month.

In Phase 3 trials, HEPLISAV-B demonstrated higher and earlier protection with fewer doses than a currently licensed hepatitis B vaccine. The investigational vaccine's safety profile is based on clinical trials that generated safety data from more than 14,000 participants. The most frequently reported local reaction was injection site pain. The most common systemic reactions were fatigue, headache and malaise, all of which were similar to an existing vaccine.

Dynavax has worldwide commercial rights to HEPLISAV-B.

About Dynavax
Dynavax, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, discovers and develops novel vaccines and therapeutics in the areas of infectious diseases and oncology. Dynavax's lead product candidates are HEPLISAV-B, a Phase 3 investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine, and SD-101, an investigational cancer immunotherapeutic currently in several Phase 1/2 studies.

About Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is a viral disease of the liver that can become chronic and can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. In the United States, the CDC estimates that approximately 20,000 hepatitis B infections continue to occur annually,(i) with the vast majority occurring in adults. There is no cure for hepatitis B, and disease prevention through effective vaccination is critical to reducing the spread of the disease. Currently marketed hepatitis B vaccines are administered in three doses over a six-month schedule. Results of a published Vaccine Safety Datalink study showed that 54 percent of adults completed the currently available three-dose hepatitis B vaccine series in one year. Those who do not complete the series may not be adequately protected against hepatitis B.  About HEPLISAV-B HEPLISAV-B is an investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine that combines hepatitis B surface antigen with a proprietary Toll-like receptor 9 agonist to enhance the immune response. HEPLISAV-B is administered in two doses over one month.  In Phase 3 trials, HEPLISAV-B demonstrated higher and earlier protection with fewer doses than a currently licensed hepatitis B vaccine. The investigational vaccine's safety profile is based on clinical trials that generated safety data from more than 14,000 participants. The most frequently reported local reaction was injection site pain. The most common systemic reactions were fatigue, headache and malaise, all of which were similar to an existing vaccine.  Dynavax has worldwide commercial rights to HEPLISAV-B.  About Dynavax Dynavax, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, discovers and develops novel vaccines and therapeutics in the areas of infectious diseases and oncology. Dynavax's lead product candidates are HEPLISAV-B, a Phase 3 investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine, and SD-101, an investigational cancer immunotherapeutic currently in several Phase 1/2 studies.

Fabry Disease
  Regulatory Plan for Full Approval Pathway Based on
  Generation of Additional Gastrointestinal Symptoms Data
  Intermediate Expanded Access Program Expected to Begin in 2017
  Conference Call Today at 4:30pm ET
  CRANBURY, N.J., Nov. 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amicus Therapeutics
(Nasdaq:FOLD), a global biotechnology company at the forefront of rare and
orphan diseases, announces its planned regulatory pathway to collect
additional data to support full approval for the oral precision medicine
migalastat for Fabry disease. Following several collaborative discussions
with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including the receipt of
final written minutes from an in-person Type B meeting, the Company plans to
collect additional data on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in Fabry patients
who have an amenable mutation.
  Key elements of the additional data generation required for full approval of
migalastat in the United States may include:
   -- Randomized, 12-month, placebo-controlled pivotal ""cross-over"" study in
      treatment na&#239;ve Fabry patients who have an amenable mutation and GI


      symptoms


   -- Crossover study design provides sufficient powering with a small number
      of patients (35 patients planned)


   -- Primary endpoint to assess diarrhea based upon established FDA irritable


      bowel syndrome (IBS) guidance1


   -- Amicus is working with FDA to finalize the clinical protocol and plans
to
      initiate enrollment in 2017, with data expected in 2019


   -- Upon successful NDA filing, the review will be based upon these new data


      and the totality of the data from all prior migalastat studies


   -- Intermediate Expanded Access Program (EAP) planned to ensure short-term
      access to migalastat for U.S. patients who are currently on ERT and meet


      EAP requirements


   -- U.S. patients currently enrolled in ongoing clinical extension studies
      will continue to receive migalastat
  During its review of the briefing document submitted and in discussions with
Amicus, the FDA acknowledged that significant unmet medical need exists in
Fabry disease. The agency also indicated that kidney globotriaosylceramide
(GL-3) is currently not considered a basis for an accelerated approval under
Subpart H.
  John F. Crowley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Amicus
Therapeutics, Inc. stated, ""While we believe that the totality of the data
from our studies with migalastat support the submission of a new drug
application today, we acknowledge the FDA's position that accelerated
approval based on kidney GL-3 reduction is not currently an option. We have
thus defined a plan to collect additional GI data to support full approval
for migalastat that we believe is feasible in a reasonable amount of time
and with a high likelihood of success based on positive GI data generated in
our previous Phase 3 Study 011. FDA has been flexible in allowing a
crossover design and in our use of established GI endpoints to measure
clinical benefit in Fabry patients. We are fully committed to the additional
work necessary to move migalastat toward approval in the United States.""
  More than 50% of patients with Fabry disease report or show GI signs and
symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, and
vomiting.(2) Amicus previously presented positive GI data in a completed
Phase 3 randomized, placebo controlled Study 011 (FACETS) in
treatment-na&#239;ve Fabry patients with amenable mutations. The GI data
from this study showed a significant decrease in diarrhea (unadjusted
p=0.03) in patients with amenable mutations treated with migalastat versus
placebo during the 6-month double-blind phase (Stage 1), which persisted
after 18-24 months of treatment with migalastat.
  ""There are significant unmet needs and a lack of treatment choices for
people living with Fabry disease in the U.S.,"" said Jack Johnson, Founder
and Executive Director of the Fabry Support & Information Group (FSIG).
""Amicus has been an outstanding partner for the Fabry community for more
than a decade, incorporating the patient's perspective throughout the entire
migalastat development program and providing valuable research for the Fabry
community. I look forward to the continued advancement of migalastat for
patients with amenable mutations in the U.S.""
  The U.S. market for migalastat is estimated to be approximately 25% of the
global opportunity.
  Migalastat is designed to selectively and reversibly bind with high affinity
to the active sites of certain mutant forms of alpha-Gal A, the genotypes of
which are referred to as amenable mutations. On May 30, 2016, the European
Commission granted full approval for migalastat, under the trade name
Galafold(TM), as a first line therapy for long-term treatment of adults and
adolescents aged 16 years and older with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry
disease (alpha-galactosidase A deficiency) and who have an amenable
mutation. This EU approval may serve as the basis for regulatory approvals
in more than two-thirds of the global Fabry market that is outside the U.S.
Amicus has commenced the commercial launch of Galafold in Germany and is
undergoing the EU country-by-country processes to launch in the majority of
EU countries throughout 2016 and 2017. The Company has also initiated
expanded access programs (EAP) in the EU and other territories outside the
U.S. that provide this mechanism for reimbursed access prior to formal
approval.

  About Galafold(TM) and Amenable Mutations
  Galafold(TM) (migalastat) is a first-in-class chaperone therapy approved in
the EU as a monotherapy for Fabry disease in patients with amenable
mutations. Galafold works by stabilizing the body's own dysfunctional
enzyme, so it can clear the accumulation of disease substrate in patients
who have amenable mutations.  A proprietary in vitro assay (Galafold
Amenability Assay) was used to classify more than 800 known GLA mutations as
""amenable"" or ""not amenable"" to treatment with Galafold. The current EU
label includes 313 GLA mutations that have been identified and determined to
be amenable based on the Galafold Amenability Assay, which represent between
35% and 50% of the currently diagnosed Fabry population.
  Healthcare providers in the EU may access the website
www.galafoldamenabilitytable.com to quickly and accurately identify which
mutations are categorized as ""amenable"" or ""not amenable"" to Galafold.
Amicus expects to submit updates to the label as additional GLA mutations
are identified and tested in the Galafold Amenability Assay.
  Important Safety Information from the EU Approval
  Treatment with GALAFOLD should be initiated and supervised by specialists
experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of Fabry disease. GALAFOLD is not
recommended for use in patients with a nonamenable mutation.
   -- GALAFOLD is not intended for concomitant use with enzyme replacement
      therapy.


   -- GALAFOLD is not recommended for use in patients with Fabry disease who
      have severe renal impairment (<30 mL/min/1.73 m2). The safety and
      efficacy of GALAFOLD in children 0--15 years of age have not yet been
      established.


   -- No dosage adjustments are required in patients with hepatic impairment
or
      in the elderly population.


   -- There is very limited experience with the use of this medicine in
      pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are
      planning to have a baby, do not take this medicine until you have
checked
      with your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.

      known whether GALAFOLD is excreted in human milk.


   -- Contraindications to GALAFOLD include hypersensitivity to the active
      substance or to any of the excipients listed in the PRESCRIBING
      INFORMATION.


   -- It is advised to periodically monitor renal function, echocardiographic
      parameters and biochemical markers (every 6 months) in patients
initiated
      on GALAFOLD or switched to GALAFOLD.


   -- OVERDOSE: General medical care is recommended in the case of GALAFOLD
      overdose.


   -- The most common adverse reaction reported was headache, which was
      experienced by approximately 10% of patients who received GALAFOLD. For
a

The current trials will be expanded to Phase 3 trials to facilitate potential for global registration

If successfully developed, SAGE-547 has the potential to be the first FDA-approved treatment for postpartum depression

Sage Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SAGE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced its expedited development plan for SAGE-547 following receipt of formal meeting minutes from a breakthrough therapy meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This program is intended to support a potential filing for approval in the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD).

The current SAGE-547 program in PPD, along with prior Phase 2 data, were confirmed as supporting, if successful, a potential New Drug Application (NDA). Sage’s PPD clinical program, now in Phase 3, will require only minor modifications, including an increase in sample size. Agreement with the FDA was achieved on the clinical endpoints for these pivotal trials. Sage anticipates announcing top-line data from the PPD registration trials in 2H 2017. In July 2016, Sage reported encouraging top-line results from the 202A placebo-controlled trial in women with severe PPD, in which SAGE-547 achieved a significant, rapid and durable reduction (at Day 30) in depression scores compared with placebo.

“We are encouraged by the FDA’s feedback and appreciate their guidance regarding our SAGE-547 development program in postpartum depression,” said Jeff Jonas, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Sage. “Based on our meeting, we have clear and efficient direction for the expedited development path forward for SAGE-547 to potentially support a New Drug Application (NDA) in 2018.”

As confirmed by the FDA, the following are the elements of the expected clinical and regulatory path moving forward:

Agreement and clarity was achieved with the FDA on an expedited path forward
Current SAGE-547 clinical studies confirmed as appropriate to support registration, if successful
No additional efficacy studies expected to be required beyond those currently underway
Trial design of studies 202B and 202C are considered appropriate for registration, with increase in size and other minor modifications
The primary clinical endpoint for these pivotal trials was unchanged and agreed upon with FDA
Additional patient safety data may be acquired through an open-label program
Sage received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for SAGE-547 in PPD in September, 2016. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to offer a potentially expedited development path and review for promising drug candidates, which includes increased interaction and guidance from the FDA. Sage achieved this regulatory designation based primarily on the positive results from the placebo-controlled 202A study of SAGE-547 in 21 patients with severe PPD. The trial met the primary endpoint of significant reduction in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score in the SAGE-547-treated group compared with placebo at 60 hours, with an effect that was maintained at similar magnitude through the 30-day follow-up period. SAGE-547 was generally well tolerated in the study. There were no deaths, serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events.

About FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation

The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a drug candidate that is planned for use, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy Designation include the same benefits as Fast Track Designation, plus an organizational commitment involving FDA’s senior managers with more intensive guidance from the FDA. Breakthrough Therapy Designation does not change the standards for approval.

About Postpartum Depression

Postpartum depression (PPD) is an affective disorder impacting women after childbirth. PPD may have devastating consequences for a woman and for her family, which may include significant functional impairment, depressed mood and/or loss of interest in her newborn, and associated symptoms of depression such as loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, motor challenges, lack of concentration, loss of energy and poor self-esteem. Suicide is the leading cause of maternal death following childbirth. It is estimated that PPD affects 500,000 to 750,000 mothers in the US each year1,2. A subset of these are severe enough to require hospitalization. There are no approved therapies for PPD and there is a high unmet medical need for improved pharmacological therapy in PPD.

About SAGE-547

SAGE-547 is an allosteric modulator of both synaptic and extra-synaptic GABAA receptors. SAGE-547 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD). SAGE-547 is an intravenous agent evaluated in the PPD-202A trial, a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of SAGE-547 in the treatment of adult female patients with severe PPD. Following top-line results in July 2016, Sage initiated an expansion of the clinical program of SAGE-547 in PPD with two randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to explore dose-ranging of SAGE-547 in severe PPD patients and to evaluate SAGE-547 efficacy in moderate PPD patients. For more information about participating in these trials, please contact clinicaltrials@sagerx.com.

SAGE-547 is also being developed as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) in the global Phase 3 STATUS Trial. For more information about the STATUS Trial, please visit www.statustrial.com. SAGE-547 has been granted both Fast Track and orphan drug designations by the FDA for the treatment of SRSE.

Sage has a portfolio of novel product candidates targeting critical CNS receptor systems, GABA and NMDA. Sage's lead compound, SAGE-547, is in Phase 3 clinical development for super-refractory status epilepticus, a rare and severe seizure disorder, and for postpartum depression. Sage is developing its next generation modulators, including SAGE-217 and SAGE-718, with a focus on acute and chronic CNS disorders. For more information, please visit www.sagerx.com.","Current SAGE-547 clinical program is designed to support potential NDA submission; no additional controlled studies anticipated  The current trials will be expanded to Phase 3 trials to facilitate potential for global registration  If successfully developed, SAGE-547 has the potential to be the first FDA-approved treatment for postpartum depression  Sage Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SAGE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced its expedited development plan for SAGE-547 following receipt of formal meeting minutes from a breakthrough therapy meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This program is intended to support a potential filing for approval in the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD).  The current SAGE-547 program in PPD, along with prior Phase 2 data, were confirmed as supporting, if successful, a potential New Drug Application (NDA). Sage’s PPD clinical program, now in Phase 3, will require only minor modifications, including an increase in sample size. Agreement with the FDA was achieved on the clinical endpoints for these pivotal trials. Sage anticipates announcing top-line data from the PPD registration trials in 2H 2017. In July 2016, Sage reported encouraging top-line results from the 202A placebo-controlled trial in women with severe PPD, in which SAGE-547 achieved a significant, rapid and durable reduction (at Day 30) in depression scores compared with placebo.  “We are encouraged by the FDA’s feedback and appreciate their guidance regarding our SAGE-547 development program in postpartum depression,” said Jeff Jonas, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Sage. “Based on our meeting, we have clear and efficient direction for the expedited development path forward for SAGE-547 to potentially support a New Drug Application (NDA) in 2018.”  As confirmed by the FDA, the following are the elements of the expected clinical and regulatory path moving forward:  Agreement and clarity was achieved with the FDA on an expedited path forward Current SAGE-547 clinical studies confirmed as appropriate to support registration, if successful No additional efficacy studies expected to be required beyond those currently underway Trial design of studies 202B and 202C are considered appropriate for registration, with increase in size and other minor modifications The primary clinical endpoint for these pivotal trials was unchanged and agreed upon with FDA Additional patient safety data may be acquired through an open-label program Sage received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for SAGE-547 in PPD in September, 2016. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to offer a potentially expedited development path and review for promising drug candidates, which includes increased interaction and guidance from the FDA. Sage achieved this regulatory designation based primarily on the positive results from the placebo-controlled 202A study of SAGE-547 in 21 patients with severe PPD. The trial met the primary endpoint of significant reduction in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score in the SAGE-547-treated group compared with placebo at 60 hours, with an effect that was maintained at similar magnitude through the 30-day follow-up period. SAGE-547 was generally well tolerated in the study. There were no deaths, serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events.  About FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation  The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a drug candidate that is planned for use, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy Designation include the same benefits as Fast Track Designation, plus an organizational commitment involving FDA’s senior managers with more intensive guidance from the FDA. Breakthrough Therapy Designation does not change the standards for approval.  About Postpartum Depression  Postpartum depression (PPD) is an affective disorder impacting women after childbirth. PPD may have devastating consequences for a woman and for her family, which may include significant functional impairment, depressed mood and/or loss of interest in her newborn, and associated symptoms of depression such as loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, motor challenges, lack of concentration, loss of energy and poor self-esteem. Suicide is the leading cause of maternal death following childbirth. It is estimated that PPD affects 500,000 to 750,000 mothers in the US each year1,2. A subset of these are severe enough to require hospitalization. There are no approved therapies for PPD and there is a high unmet medical need for improved pharmacological therapy in PPD.  About SAGE-547  SAGE-547 is an allosteric modulator of both synaptic and extra-synaptic GABAA receptors. SAGE-547 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD). SAGE-547 is an intravenous agent evaluated in the PPD-202A trial, a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of SAGE-547 in the treatment of adult female patients with severe PPD.

and other conditions, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) will not meet the previously announced October 14
prescription drug user fee act (PDUFA) date for ARYMO(TM) ER (morphine
sulfate).
  ""Today we were informed that the FDA has identified no particular issue with
our application for ARYMO ER and that the Agency is working on the product
label,"" said Bob Radie, president and chief executive officer. """"The FDA
indicated that they need more time as they have done with other
abuse-deterrent opioid NDAs, and confirmed that no additional scientific
information or data is needed for our application. We will continue to work
closely with the FDA to bring this important product to those living with
chronic pain and the healthcare professionals who treat them.""
  On August 4, 2016 an FDA Advisory Committee voted 18 to 1 for approval of
ARYMO ER and the Committee recommended ARYMO ER should be labeled as an
abuse-deterrent product by the intravenous, nasal and oral routes of abuse.
ARYMO ER is being developed for the management of pain severe enough to
require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which
alternative treatment options are inadequate. If approved, ARYMO ER would be

  Guardian(TM) Technology
  Egalet's Guardian Technology has many applications and has been used to
develop commonly abused prescription medications in an abuse-deterrent form.
Egalet's proprietary Guardian Technology is a polymer matrix tablet
technology that utilizes a novel application of the well characterized
manufacturing process of injection molding, which results in tablets with
controlled-release properties as well as physical and chemical features that
have been demonstrated to resist both common and rigorous methods of
manipulation. Guardian Technology results in tablets that are extremely
hard, very difficult to chew, resistant to particle size reduction, and
inhibit/block attempts at chemical extraction of the active pharmaceutical
ingredient. In addition, the technology results in a viscous hydrogel on
contact with liquid, making syringeability very difficult. These features
are important to address the risk of accidental misuse (e.g., chewing) in
patients with chronic pain, as well as intentional abuse using more rigorous
methods of manipulation.","Egalet Notified that FDA Will Not Meet PDUFA Goal Data for ARYMO ER   No additional scientific information or data requested by FDA   PR Newswire   WAYNE, Pa., Oct. 13, 2016   WAYNE, Pa., Oct. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Egalet Corporation (Nasdaq: EGLT) (""Egalet""), a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will not meet the previously announced October 14 prescription drug user fee act (PDUFA) date for ARYMO(TM) ER (morphine sulfate).

of Los Angeles, Calif.
  RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM) is designed with a patented unidirectional valve and
air filter technology that eliminates the need for a preservative. The new
multi-dose bottle uses less plastic than a package of single-use vials and
will be available for the same price.
  ""RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM) exemplifies Allergan's commitment to innovation and
customer responsiveness,"" said David Nicholson, Chief R&D Officer at
Allergan.  ""Through our Open Science model, we drive to deliver advancements
in highly engineered developments, such as the new multi-dose bottle.""
  About Chronic Dry Eye
  One type of chronic dry eye is caused by reduced tear production due to
inflammation. Dry eye is often a chronic disease that can be caused by
advanced age, contact lens wear, certain medications, eye diseases, other
medical conditions or environmental factors. Without enough tears, the film
protecting the eye can break down, creating dry spots on the cornea.
  About RESTASIS
  RESTASIS(R) and RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM) Ophthalmic Emulsion help increase
your eyes' natural ability to produce tears, which may be reduced by
inflammation due to Chronic Dry Eye. RESTASIS(R) and RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM)
did not increase tear production in patients using anti-inflammatory eye
drops or tear duct plugs.
  Important Safety Information
  Do not use RESTASIS(R) and RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM) Ophthalmic Emulsion if you
are allergic to any of the ingredients.  Be careful not to touch the
container tip to your eye or other surfaces, to help avoid eye injury and
contamination.  RESTASIS(R) and RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM) should not be used
while wearing contact lenses. If contact lenses are worn, they should be
removed prior to use of RESTASIS(R) and RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM) and may be
reinserted after 15 minutes.
  The most common side effect is a temporary burning sensation. Other side
effects include eye redness, discharge, watery eyes, eye pain, foreign body
sensation, itching, stinging, and blurred vision.

ORTHOVISC-T is designed to provide lubrication to the site of the damaged tendons to promote tendon gliding and to provide an environment to support tendon repair. ORTHOVISC-T is the latest addition to Anika’s product portfolio, which includes, among other products, HYALOFAST®, a biodegradable, hyaluronic acid-based scaffold for hyaline-like cartilage regeneration to treat cartilage injuries and defects. Both HYALOFAST and ORTHOVISC-T are CE Marked and pending regulatory submission in the United States. 

“We’re excited to announce the timely European approval of ORTHOVISC-T for the treatment of pain associated with one of the most common overuse injuries to connective tissues, the condition commonly described as tennis elbow,” said Charles H. Sherwood, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer. “The availability of ORTHOVISC-T not only promises to help millions of people in Europe find relief from this painful condition, it also expands our global foothold in orthopedic medicine and provides real-world clinical experience to inform our path towards regulatory submission in the U.S.” 

ORTHOVISC-T is administered via injection into the site of injury to relieve pain and restore function of tendons damaged by chronic injury and overuse, as often seen in tennis elbow. ORTHOVISC-T consists of a biocompatible, non-animal-derived and non-inflammatory formulation of hyaluronic acid similar to those found in the company’s best-selling viscosupplements, ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC®. 

“Degenerative overuse injuries to tendons are a leading cause of pain and restricted activity, and, until now, treatments were limited to oral medications, physical and/or occupational therapy, and corticosteroid injections,” said Peter M.

“Recurrent ovarian cancer remains one of the most difficult cancers to treat and for so many years, medical advances in this space have been limited,” said Robert L. Coleman, MD, Professor & Deputy Chairman, Vice Chair, Clinical Research, Ann Rife Cox Chair in Gynecology, Department of Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and one of the Principal Investigators in the ARIEL clinical trial program. “Today’s approval of Rubraca for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer demonstrates the value of treatment with PARP inhibitors and represents an important advance for women diagnosed with either germline or somatic BRCA-mutated tumors who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies.” 

“We believe that today’s approval of Rubraca provides an important new therapy for advanced ovarian cancer patients with a germline or somatic mutation of BRCA after two or more chemotherapies,” said Patrick J. Mahaffy, CEO and President of Clovis Oncology. “We look forward to launching Rubraca with the support of our established U.S. commercial and medical affairs organizations and bringing this much-needed precision medicine to women with advanced ovarian cancer as quickly as possible.” 

""NOCC commends Clovis Oncology for its commitment to bringing a new treatment option to women living with ovarian cancer, the deadliest cancer of the female reproductive system. All too often, women are diagnosed when the disease is far advanced, leaving them with few viable treatment options,” said David Barley, Chief Executive Officer, National Ovarian Cancer Coalition. “The development and FDA approval of therapies for use in third-line is a promising step forward for the tens of thousands of women who will battle ovarian cancer in their lifetime."" 

“Ovarian cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to detect. For this reason, most women who develop ovarian cancer are diagnosed with advanced disease,"" said Sue Friedman, DVM, Executive Director of Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered. ""There is a tremendous need for new ways to treat women with advanced ovarian cancer and ways to find those women who will respond to therapies such as PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibitors, like Rubraca, represent an exciting advancement for appropriate patients."" 

The Rubraca NDA filing received Priority Review and was reviewed and approved under FDA’s Accelerated Approval program. These programs allow for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions and that fill an unmet medical need. The application was based on objective response rate and duration of response results from two multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trials, Study 1 (Study 10, NCT01482715) and Study 2 (ARIEL2 Parts 1 and 2, NCT01891344), in women with advanced BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer who had progressed after two or more prior chemotherapies. All 106 patients received Rubraca orally 600 mg twice daily as monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) were assessed by the investigator and independent radiology review (IRR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. 

Clovis partnered with Foundation Medicine, Inc. to co-develop a companion diagnostic test, the FDA approved FoundationFocusTM CDxBRCA, to select patients for Rubraca treatment. FoundationFocus CDxBRCA is a tissue-based, genomic assay that detects tumor BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations (germline and/or somatic) in ovarian cancer. 

Efficacy and safety results from the U.S. Prescribing Information are summarized below: 

Overall Response and Duration of Response in Patients with BRCA-mutant Ovarian Cancer Who Received 2 or More Chemotherapies in Study 1 and Study 2 

                   
           Investigator-assessed 

N=106 
  
  Objective Response Rate (95% CI)        54% (44, 64)   
  Complete Response        9%   
  Partial Response        45%   
  Median DOR in months (95% CI)        9.2 (6.6, 11.6)   
           

Response assessment by IRR was 42% (95% CI: 32, 52), with a median DOR of 6.7 months (95% CI: 5.5, 11.1). Investigator-assessed ORR was 66% (52/79; 95% CI: 54, 76) in platinum-sensitive patients, 25% (5/20; 95% CI: 9, 49) in platinum-resistant patients, and 0% (0/7; 95% CI: 0, 41) in platinum-refractory patients. ORR was similar for patients with a BRCA1 gene mutation or BRCA2 gene mutation. 

The overall safety evaluation of Rubraca 600 mg twice daily as monotherapy is based on data from 377 patients with ovarian cancer treated in two open-label, single arm trials. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20% of patients; Grade 1-4) were nausea, asthenia/fatigue, vomiting, anemia, constipation, dysgeusia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia and dyspnea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (≥ 35% of patients; Grade 1-4) were increase in creatinine, increase in ALT, increase in AST, decrease in hemoglobin, decrease in lymphocytes, increase in cholesterol, decrease in platelets and decrease in absolute neutrophil count.

About RubracaTM (rucaparib) 

Rubraca is a PARP inhibitor indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer, who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. Rubraca’s indication is approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval program based on objective response rate and duration of response, and is based on results from two multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trials. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. 

Select Important Safety Information 

There are no contraindications with Rubraca. 

Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) was reported in 2 of 377 (0.5%) patients with ovarian cancer treated with Rubraca. The duration of Rubraca treatment prior to the diagnosis of MDS/AML was 57 days and 539 days. Both patients received prior treatment with platinum and other DNA damaging agents. 

AML was reported in 2 (<1%) patients with ovarian cancer enrolled in ARIEL3, a blinded, randomized trial evaluating Rubraca versus placebo. One case of AML was fatal. The duration of treatment prior to the diagnosis of AML was 107 days and 427 days. Both patients had received prior treatment with platinum and other DNA damaging agents. 

Do not start Rubraca until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤ Grade 1). 

Monitor complete blood count testing at baseline and monthly thereafter. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt Rubraca and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue Rubraca. 

Rubraca can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies. Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of Rubraca. 

Most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%; Grade 1-4) were nausea (77%), asthenia/fatigue (77%), vomiting (46%), anemia (44%), constipation (40%), dysgeusia (39%), decreased appetite (39%), diarrhea (34%), abdominal pain (32%), dyspnea (21%), and thrombocytopenia (21%). 

Most common laboratory abnormalities (≥ 35%; Grade 1-4) were increase in creatinine (92%), increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (74%), increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (73%), decrease in hemoglobin (67%), decrease in lymphocytes (45%), increase in cholesterol (40%), decrease in platelets (39%), and decrease in absolute neutrophil count (35%). 

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed infants from Rubraca, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with Rubraca and for 2 weeks after the final dose.

  About Larotrectinib (LOXO-101)
  Larotrectinib (LOXO-101) is a potent, oral and selective investigational new
drug in clinical development for the treatment of patients with cancers that
harbor abnormalities involving the tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRKs).
Growing research suggests that the NTRK genes, which encode for TRKs, can
become abnormally fused to other genes, resulting in growth signals that can
lead to cancer in many sites of the body. In an ongoing Phase 1 clinical
trial, larotrectinib has demonstrated encouraging preliminary efficacy.
Larotrectinib is also being evaluated in the NAVIGATE global Phase 2
multi-center basket trial in patients with solid tumors that harbor TRK gene
fusions, and the SCOUT Phase 1/2 trial in pediatric patients, including
patients with advanced cancer, TRK gene fusions and infantile fibrosarcoma.
Larotrectinib has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Rare
Pediatric Disease Designation by the U.S. FDA. For additional information
about the larotrectinib clinical trials, please refer to
www.clinicaltrials.gov. Interested patients and physicians can contact the
Loxo Oncology Physician and Patient Clinical Trial Hotline at 1-855-NTRK-123

-- Pivotal DLBCL trial expected to begin in 2017

Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: JUNO) and Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to investigational drug JCAR017 for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) aggressive large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), not otherwise specified (de novo or transformed from indolent lymphoma), Primary Mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) or Grade 3B Follicular Lymphoma. In addition, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) have granted JCAR017 access to the Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme for r/r DLBCL.

JCAR017 uses a defined CD4:CD8 cell composition and 4-1BB as the costimulatory domain, which differentiates it from other CD19-directed CAR T product candidates in clinical development. Earlier this month, data from multiple phase I studies with JCAR017 in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia were presented at the 58th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.

“The Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA and PRIME eligibility from EMA for JCAR017 highlight the need for new treatment options for patients with DLBCL, particularly for the significant number of patients who do not respond to initial therapy or with relapsed disease,” said Mark J. Gilbert, M.D., Juno’s Chief Medical Officer. “Early data with JCAR017 in a range of B-cell malignancies has been encouraging and we look forward to initiating a pivotal trial in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL in the U.S. in 2017.”

“The encouraging news of the FDA Breakthrough Therapy and EMA PRIME designations reflect the agencies’ emphasis on accelerating the development and assessment of potential new options for serious blood cancers like DLBCL,” said Jay Backstrom, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Regulatory Affairs for Celgene. “We will continue to work closely with our partners at Juno and with the agencies to move the JCAR017 program forward in the interest of patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.”

The Breakthrough Therapy designation and PRIME eligibility were granted by the FDA and EMA, respectively, on the basis of early clinical results with JCAR017 in r/r DLBCL. According to the FDA, Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with early evidence of potential clinical benefit in serious diseases. PRIME was launched by the EMA earlier this year and enables accelerated assessment of therapeutic applications that target an unmet medical need, focusing on medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients with no treatment options.

JCAR017 is not approved in any country. FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation and access to EMA’s Priority Medicines scheme does not constitute or guarantee a future approval.

its Investigational New Drug application for KP201/IR has been granted ""Fast
Track"" designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). KP201/IR,
KemPharm's co-lead product candidate, is a single-entity benzhydrocodone HCl
immediate release abuse-deterrent prodrug for the treatment of acute pain.
KemPharm expects to initiate human clinical trials of KP201/IR in the first
half of 2017.
  ""We are very pleased that the FDA has granted KP201/IR 'Fast Track'
designation.  This designation will help expedite the development and review
of KP201/IR and provides us with the opportunity to have more frequent
interactions with the Agency and a potential 'rolling review' of our
application prior to submission of the complete New Drug Application (NDA)
for KP201/IR,"" said Travis Mickle, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive
Officer of KemPharm.  ""As previously announced, we intend to initiate human
clinical trials of KP201/IR in the first half of 2017 and remain on target
for a potential submission in 2018 of the KP201/IR NDA.""
  KP201/IR has the potential to reach the market as the first abuse-deterrent
IR hydrocodone product, as well as the first IR hydrocodone-related product
without acetaminophen (APAP).  KemPharm believes KP201/IR is well-positioned
to take advantage of data generated from the Apadaz(TM) development program,
including data from the KP201.A03 study, which compared hydrocodone exposure
following insufflation of benzhydrocodone HCl (KP201) vs. hydrocodone
bitartrate. KemPharm believes that the data observed in the KP201.A03 study,
if replicated in a full human abuse potential study, may align with the FDA
Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products criteria for
achieving abuse-deterrent product labeling.
  About Fast Track Designation
  Fast track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite
the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical
need. The purpose is to get important new drugs to the patient earlier.
  A drug that receives Fast Track designation is eligible for some or all of
the following:
   -- More frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the drug's development plan
      and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug
approval

   -- Eligibility for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review, if relevant
      criteria are met

   -- Rolling Review, which means that a drug company can submit completed
      sections of its NDA for review by the FDA, rather than waiting until
      every section of the NDA is completed before the entire application can
      be reviewed.

  -Single Phase 3 clinical trial to be conducted with 23.7mg BID voclosporin
for the treatment of active lupus nephritis (LN)
  -Trial on track to commence in Q2 2017
VICTORIA, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 13, 2016--
  Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:AUPH)(TSX:AUP) (""Aurinia"" or the
""Company""), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the global
immunology market, today announced that it has received the final End of
Phase II (EOP2) meeting minutes from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration
Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products. The minutes are
consistent with the preliminary responses that were issued to the Company
prior to the meeting which took place on October 25, 2016.
  As previously communicated, Aurinia will be conducting a single, Phase 3
clinical trial assessing 23.7mg BID for the treatment of active lupus
nephritis (LN). The trial, which will be known as AURORA, will be a global
52-week trial in approximately 320 patients. The primary endpoint as in the
Phase 2b AURA trial is renal response (complete remission), at 24 weeks. In
addition to the assessment of renal response, a key marker of clinical
benefit in this population is the duration of proteinuria improvement.
Therefore, secondary endpoints will include the duration of renal response
at 52 weeks (48 weeks in AURA), an efficacy measure which delineates
durability of renal response (remission), an important parameter in
evaluating long-term outcomes for the treatment of LN.
  Aurinia believes this Phase 3 clinical trial will support a New Drug
Application (NDA) submission.
  ""We have thoroughly reviewed the final EOP2 meeting minutes provided to us
by FDA, which are consistent with our previous assessment and are moving as
quickly as we can to initiate the AURORA trial,"" commented Lawrence D.
Mandt, Vice President of Quality and Regulatory Affairs at Aurinia.
  ""We are pleased to be working closely with FDA to bring this treatment to
market and helping as many people as possible suffering from this
debilitating disease,"" added Charles Rowland, Aurinia's Chief Executive
Officer. ""Our clinical team has been working on preparations for this
important trial to meet our goal of enrolling the first patient in Q2 2017.
In the meantime, we expect the AURA 48-week secondary endpoint durability of
renal response data in Q1 next year.""
  About Voclosporin
  Voclosporin, an investigational drug, is a novel and potentially
best-in-class calcineurin inhibitor (""CNI"") with clinical data in over 2,000
patients across indications. The drug has received ""Fast Track Designation
from the U.S. FDA. Voclosporin is an immunosuppressant, with a synergistic
and dual mechanism of action that has the potential to improve near- and
long-term outcomes in LN when added to standard of care (MMF). By inhibiting
calcineurin, voclosporin blocks IL-2 expression and T-cell mediated immune
responses. It is made by a modification of a single amino acid of the
cyclosporine molecule which has shown a more predictable pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic relationship, an increase in potency, an altered metabolic
profile, and potential for flat dosing. The Company anticipates that upon
regulatory approval, patent protection for voclosporin will be extended in
the United States and certain other major markets, including Europe and
Japan, until at least October 2027 under the Hatch-Waxman Act and comparable
laws in other countries.
  About Lupus Nephritis (LN)
  Lupus Nephritis (LN) in an inflammation of the kidney caused by Systemic
Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and represents a serious progression of SLE. SLE
is a chronic, complex and often disabling disorder and affects more than
500,000 people in the United States (mostly women). The disease is highly
heterogeneous, affecting a wide range of organs & tissue systems. It is
estimated that as many as 60% of all SLE patients have clinical LN requiring
treatment. Unlike SLE, LN has straightforward disease outcomes where an
early response correlates with long-term outcomes, measured by proteinuria.
In patients with LN, renal damage results in proteinuria and/or hematuria
and a decrease in renal function as evidenced by reduced estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and increased serum creatinine levels. LN
is debilitating and costly and if poorly controlled, LN can lead to
permanent and irreversible tissue damage within the kidney, resulting in
end-stage renal disease (ESRD), thus making LN a serious and potentially
life-threatening condition.
  About AURORA
  The AURORA study is a 52-week global double-blind placebo controlled Phase
III study that will compare the efficacy of one dose of voclosporin (23.7mg
BID) or placebo added to current standard of care of mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF, also known as CellCept(R)) in achieving renal response (formerly
referred to as complete remission) in patients with active LN. Both arms
will also receive low doses of corticosteroids as part of background therapy
after a stringent taper. Aurinia believes this Phase III clinical trial
whose design is consistent with the ongoing AURA study, will support a New
Drug Application (NDA) submission.
  About Aurinia
  Aurinia is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing
and commercializing therapies to treat targeted patient populations that are
suffering from serious diseases with a high unmet medical need. The company
is currently developing voclosporin, an investigational drug, for the

  CUPERTINO, Calif., Sept. 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- DURECT Corporation
(Nasdaq: DRRX) today announced that its licensee, Pain Therapeutics (Nasdaq:
PTIE) has received a Complete Response Letter from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for Pain Therapeutics' New Drug Application (NDA) for
REMOXY(R) ER (oxycodone) extended-release capsules CII.  Based on its
review, the FDA has determined that the NDA cannot be approved in its
present form and specifies additional actions and data that are needed for
drug approval.
  In a press release issued this morning by Pain Therapeutics, Pain
Therapeutics states that ""The CRL focuses on the abuse-deterrent properties
of REMOXY ER and proposed drug labeling.  The CRL makes no mention of
clinical safety, drug efficacy, manufacturing, stability, bioequivalence or
any other issues from a prior Complete Response Letter.""
  The announcement continues that ""Pain Therapeutics is evaluating the CRL and
plan further discussions with the FDA.  The CRL specifies additional actions
that are needed in order to obtain approval of REMOXY ER with label claims
against three routes of abuse (i.e., injection, inhalation and snorting).
These actions may take approximately a year to conduct and may cost
approximately $5MM, pending discussions with the FDA and outside

  In addition, the Pain Therapeutics provides the following details of the
Complete Response Letter (CRL):
  ""The CRL focuses on the actions and studies that are needed in order to
obtain approval of REMOXY ER with label claims on three routes of abuse
(i.e., injection, inhalation and snorting). In conducting the following
studies, we will generally compare REMOXY ER vs. one or more commercially
available oxycodone ER drug product:
   -- To support a potential drug label claim against abuse by injection:
      Repeat an injectability/syringeability study using thin films of drug,
      smaller volumes of solvents, additional mixed solvents and alternative
      extraction methods and syringe filter.

   -- To support a potential drug label claim against abuse by inhalation:
      Repeat a volatilization study using the same thickness for each drug to
      increase surface area.

   -- To support a potential drug label claim against abuse by snorting:
      Conduct an intranasal abuse potential study in human volunteers (i.e.,
      not the animal data we had submitted) with drug applied directly inside
      the human nasal cavity.
  In addition, we had proposed in the REMOXY NDA a label claim against abuse
by chewing.  Our proposal was based on clinical results of an oral human
abuse potential study that met all four co-primary endpoints with
statistical significance and that also met several, but not all, secondary
endpoints.  The CRL asks us to submit a revised proposed label to indicate
results of this study do not support a label claim against abuse by
chewing.""

  CHICAGO, Nov. 01, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AveXis, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVXS), a
clinical-stage gene therapy company developing treatments for patients
suffering from rare and life-threatening neurological genetic diseases,
today announced that the planned pivotal study of AVXS-101 in spinal
muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1 will reflect a single-arm design, using
natural history of the disease as a comparator, and enroll approximately 20
patients. This update is based on the receipt of the minutes following the
Type B meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) held on
September 30, 2016.
  In addition to evaluating safety, the planned program is expected to
evaluate achievement of motor milestones, specifically patients' ability to
sit unassisted, as well as an efficacy measure defined by the time from
birth to an ""event,"" defined as death or requiring at least 16 hours per day
of ventilation support for breathing for greater than two weeks in the
absence of an acute reversible illness, or perioperatively.
  At the Type B meeting and in the meeting minutes, the FDA acknowledged the
company's rationale for a single-arm pivotal study and provided a number of
constructive suggestions to help optimize such a trial design. The FDA also
indicated its preference for a design with co-primary endpoints consisting
of a measure of developmental milestone achievement (such as sitting
unassisted) along with a clinically meaningful measure of survival (such as
time to an ""event"" as described above). Based on FDA's suggestions as well
as other expert input, AveXis continues to evaluate a number of the details
of the trial design. More specific information will be made available at the
time the study is initiated, which is expected in the first half of 2017.
  ""We believe the Type B meeting had a positive tone, with FDA offering a
number of constructive suggestions which we believe will better enable
implementation of a pivotal study design that is most appropriate for the
patients suffering from this devastating disease,"" said Sean Nolan,
President and Chief Executive Officer of AveXis. ""With the feedback needed
from the FDA to move forward with our pivotal trial, we plan to proceed as
expeditiously as possible to begin the study in the first half of 2017.""
  With regard to the ongoing Phase 1 trial of AVXS-101, the FDA stated the
following in the meeting minutes: ""We strongly recommend that at the
completion of the study, you request an end-of-Phase 1 meeting to evaluate
the adequacy of data to support future product development, including a
discussion of whether the data from the Phase 1 study might provide the
substantial evidence necessary to support a marketing application."" 
  The company's strategy with the SMA Type 1 program is to complete the
ongoing Phase 1 trial and, in parallel, execute on the single-arm pivotal
trial, while continuing collaborative discussions with the FDA regarding the
most expeditious pathways for FDA approval of AVXS-101.

  About SMA
  SMA is a severe neuromuscular disease characterized by the loss of motor
neurons leading to progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. SMA is caused
by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene that codes SMN, a protein necessary for
the survival of motor neurons. The incidence of SMA is approximately one in
10,000 live births.
  The most severe form of SMA is Type 1, a lethal genetic disorder
characterized by motor neuron loss and associated muscle deterioration,
which results in mortality or the need for permanent ventilation support
before the age of two for greater than 90 percent of patients. SMA Type 1 is
the leading genetic cause of infant mortality.
  About AVXS-101
  AVXS-101 is a proprietary gene therapy candidate of a one-time treatment for
SMA Type 1 and is designed to address the monogenic root cause of SMA and
prevent further muscle degeneration by addressing the defective and/or loss
of the primary SMN gene. AVXS-101 also targets motor neurons, providing
rapid onset of effect, and crosses the blood brain barrier allowing an IV
dosing route and effective targeting of both central and systemic features.
  About AveXis, Inc.
  AveXis is a clinical-stage gene therapy company developing treatments for
patients suffering from rare and life-threatening neurological genetic
diseases. The company's initial proprietary gene therapy candidate,
AVXS-101, is in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of SMA

(NASDAQ:AVXS), a clinical-stage gene therapy company developing treatments for patients suffering from rare and life-threatening neurological genetic diseases, today announced that the planned pivotal study of AVXS-101 in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1 will reflect a single-arm design, using natural history of the disease as a comparator, and enroll approximately 20 patients. This update is based on the receipt of the minutes following the Type B meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) held on September 30, 2016.   In addition to evaluating safety, the planned program is expected to evaluate achievement of motor milestones, specifically patients' ability to sit unassisted, as well as an efficacy measure defined by the time from birth to an ""event,"" defined as death or requiring at least 16 hours per day of ventilation support for breathing for greater than two weeks in the absence of an acute reversible illness, or perioperatively.   At the Type B meeting and in the meeting minutes, the FDA acknowledged the company's rationale for a single-arm pivotal study and provided a number of constructive suggestions to help optimize such a trial design.

  -Trial expected to commence in Q2 2017
  -Conference Call and webcast at 8:30am ET tomorrow
VICTORIA, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 02, 2016--
  Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:AUPH) (TSX:AUP) (""Aurinia"" or the
""Company""), today announced its plans for a single Phase III clinical trial
for voclosporin in the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN). Pursuant to its
recent End of Phase II meeting with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration
(FDA) Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products, Aurinia
believes this Phase III clinical trial whose design is consistent with the
ongoing AURA study, will support a New Drug Application (NDA) submission.
  ""We are thrilled with the outcome and direction received from the FDA. With
a clear path forward for voclosporin's development to treat LN, we are
mobilizing quickly to initiate the Phase III study in Q2 next year,
fulfilling our goal of improving the long-term outcomes for patients with
this disease,"" added Charles Rowland, Aurinia's Chief Executive Officer.
  The Phase III AURORA trial will be a global 52-week double-blind, placebo
controlled study of approximately 320 patients. The Company is finalizing
the study protocol and regulatory submissions and in parallel is working on
site selection with trial initiation anticipated in Q2 2017. Patients will
be randomized 1:1: to either of 23.7mg voclosporin BID and MMF or MMF and
placebo, with both arms receiving a stringent oral corticosteroid taper. The
study population will be comprised of patients with biopsy-proven active LN
who will be evaluated on the primary efficacy endpoint of renal response at
24 weeks, a composite which includes:
   -- Urinary/protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) of <=0.7mg/mg

   -- Normal, stable renal function (>=60 mL/min/1.73m2 or no confirmed
      decrease from baseline in eGFR of >20%)

   -- Presence of sustained, low dose steroids (<=10mg prednisone from week
      16-24)

   -- No administration of rescue medications
  The readout of the primary endpoint of renal response at 24 weeks will occur
after database lock at 52 weeks at which point the Company intends to submit
an NDA. Patients completing the 52-week study will then have the option to
roll-over into a 104 week blinded continuation study. These data will allow
the Company to assess long-term outcomes in LN patients that will be
valuable in a post-marketing setting in addition to future interactions with
various regulatory authorities.
  While voclosporin has received fast track designation, the FDA has informed
the Company that voclosporin is not eligible for breakthrough therapy
designation at this time. Aurinia will continue to benefit from its fast
track designation which includes more frequent communications with the FDA
and potential for priority review and an option to submit a rolling NDA
submission, which may expedite the review process.
  ""We have shared a substantial amount of efficacy and safety data with the
FDA and are confident in our ability to execute a successful Phase III
clinical trial based on their feedback and the information gleaned from the
AURA study"", said Lawrence D. Mandt, Vice President of Quality and
Regulatory Affairs at Aurinia. ""We remain committed to addressing the unmet
needs of patients living with LN, a devastating disease, and look forward to
making this product available to patients as soon as possible.""
  Conference Call and Webcast Details
  Aurinia will host a conference call and webcast tomorrow, November 3, 2016
at 8:30a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to provide a clinical and regulatory
update on voclosporin. In order to participate in the conference call,

  About AURORA
  The AURORA study is a 52-week global double-blind placebo controlled phase
III study that will compare the efficacy of one dose of voclosporin (23.7mg
BID) or placebo added to current standard of care of mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF, also known as CellCept(R)) in achieving renal response (formerly
referred to as complete remission) in patients with active LN. Both arms
will also receive low doses of corticosteroids as part of background therapy
after a stringent taper.
  About AURA-LV
  The AURA--LV study (Aurinia Urinary protein Reduction in Active Lupus with
Voclosporin) is a 48-week study comparing the efficacy of two doses of
voclosporin added to current standard of care of MMF against standard of
care with placebo in achieving complete remission (CR) in patients with
active LN. All arms also received low doses of corticosteroids as background
therapy. 265 patients were enrolled at centers in 20 countries worldwide. On
entry to the study, patients were required to have a diagnosis of LN
according to established diagnostic criteria (American College of
Rheumatology) and clinical and biopsy features indicative of highly active
nephritis. The 24-week primary and secondary endpoints were released in Q3
2016 with 48-week results to be announced in Q1 2017. The 24-week data have
been accepted for late-breaking presentations at the American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) and American Society of Nephrology (ASN).
  About Voclosporin
  Voclosporin, an investigational drug, is a novel and potentially
best-in-class calcineurin inhibitor (""CNI"") with clinical data in over 2,000
patients in other indications. Voclosporin is an immunosuppressant, with a
synergistic and dual mechanism of action that has the potential to improve
near- and long-term outcomes in LN when added to standard of care (MMF). By
inhibiting calcineurin, voclosporin blocks IL-2 expression and T-cell
mediated immune responses. It is made by a modification of a single amino
acid of the cyclosporine molecule which has shown a more predictable
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship, an increase in potency, an
altered metabolic profile, and potential for flat dosing. The Company
anticipates that upon regulatory approval, patent protection for voclosporin
will be extended in the United States and certain other major markets,
including Europe and Japan, until at least October 2027 under the
Hatch-Waxman Act and comparable laws in other countries.
  About Lupus Nephritis (LN)
  Lupus nephritis (LN) in an inflammation of the kidney caused by systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and represents a serious progression of SLE. SLE
is a chronic, complex and often disabling disorder and affects more than
500,000 people in the United States (mostly women). The disease is highly
heterogeneous, affecting a wide range of organs & tissue systems. It is
estimated that as many as 60% of all SLE patients have clinical LN requiring
treatment. Unlike SLE, LN has straightforward disease measures where an
early response correlates with long-term outcomes, measured by proteinuria.
In patients with LN, renal damage results in proteinuria and/or hematuria
and a decrease in renal function as evidenced by reduced estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and increased serum creatinine levels. LN
is debilitating and costly and if poorly controlled, can lead to permanent
and irreversible tissue damage within the kidney, resulting in end-stage
renal disease (ESRD), thus making LN a serious and potentially
life-threatening condition.
  About Aurinia
  Aurinia is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing
and commercializing therapies to treat targeted patient populations that are
suffering from serious diseases with a high unmet medical need. The company
is currently developing voclosporin, an investigational drug, for the
treatment of lupus nephritis (LN). The company is headquartered in Victoria,
BC.

New label update for CP-CML reflects 55 percent major cytogenetic response rate (MCyR), and 39 percent major molecular response rate (MMR), a key secondary endpoint deeper than cytogenetic response
Safety and efficacy profile updated based on 48-month follow-up
ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ARIA) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Iclusig® (ponatinib) full approval for the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) for whom no other tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is indicated; and for the treatment of adult patients with T315I-positive CML (chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase) or T315I positive Ph+ ALL. Iclusig was initially approved in December 2012 under the FDA’s accelerated approval program, which provides patients earlier access to promising new drugs that treat serious conditions based on a surrogate endpoint while the company conducts additional studies to confirm the drug’s clinical benefit. The therapy was granted the FDA’s orphan drug designation because it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition.

This full approval and label update is based on 48-month follow-up data (as of August 2015) from the pivotal Phase 2 PACE clinical trial of Iclusig in heavily pretreated patients with resistant or intolerant CML or Ph+ ALL. These data were presented at the 2016 meetings of the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the European Hematology Association (EHA).

“The data on Iclusig continue to show that with a minimum follow-up of 48 months, many chronic phase CML patients in the PACE trial have retained long-term cytogenetic and molecular responses,” stated Timothy P. Clackson, Ph.D., president of research and development and chief scientific officer at ARIAD. “We are pleased to have received full approval of this medicine that was discovered and developed by ARIAD scientists to address rare cancers for patients who may have no other targeted treatment option. With this label update we are also now able to communicate to physicians that patients have experienced deep responses on Iclusig, measured by major molecular response (MMR). We are continuing our efforts to understand the optimal Iclusig dose for patients with the OPTIC (Optimizing Ponatinib Treatment In CML) post-marketing study.”

“The longer follow up of the PACE study confirms the clinical benefit of ponatinib in this setting. We had learned from the initial report of the high response rate with ponatinib among CML patients with resistance or intolerance to prior therapies. The four-year follow-up and updated safety profile demonstrate durability of responses in this heavily pre-treated population. These results solidify ponatinib as an important and valuable treatment option for refractory patients with CML where no other TKI therapy is appropriate, including those who have the T315I mutation,” stated Jorge Cortes, M.D., professor and deputy chair, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and a leading investigator in the PACE trial.

“Prior to the approval of Iclusig, there were patients with CML for whom no targeted treatment was available, either because they had developed resistance mutations or intolerance to other approved treatments. For these patients, we now have a better understanding of the long-term treatment profile of Iclusig,” stated Greg Stephens, executive director of the National CML Society. “We have been impressed by the major molecular responses some patients have been able to achieve on Iclusig and by ARIAD’s commitment to supporting patient and caregiver needs.”

Four-Year PACE Trial Data Included in Labeling Update

The efficacy and safety of ponatinib in CML and Ph+ ALL patients resistant or intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib, or with the T315I mutation, were evaluated in the PACE trial. A total of 449 patients were treated with ponatinib at a starting dose of 45 mg/day. An estimated 93 percent of patients previously received two or more approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and 56 percent of all patients had received three or more approved TKIs. Enrollment in the PACE trial was completed in October 2011.

Updated data on CP-CML patients (n=270) from the ongoing trial indicate that with a minimum follow-up of 48 months (data as of August 3, 2015), 110 patients continued to receive ponatinib. Additional data for CP-CML patients include:

55 percent of CP-CML patients achieved major cytogenetic response (MCyR) (primary endpoint) at any time.
The median duration of MCyR (range 2.7 to 50+ months) has not been reached.
39 percent of patients achieved a major molecular response (MMR) at any time.
The median duration of MMR (range 1.7 to 50+ months) has not been reached.
With four years of follow-up, 33 percent (150/449) of all patients experienced arterial occlusive events (AOE). Twenty-one percent of patients experienced cardiac vascular, 12 percent experienced peripheral vascular and 9 percent experienced cerebrovascular arterial occlusive events, with some patients experiencing more than one type of AOE. Twenty-two percent experienced arterial occlusive serious adverse reactions (12% cardiac vascular, 8% peripheral vascular and 7% cerebrovascular).
Six percent of all patients experienced a venous thromboembolic event.
The most common any-grade treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in ≥ 20 percent of CP-CML patients included hypertension (69%), rash (63%), abdominal pain (48%), fatigue (47%), headache (43%), arterial ischemia (42%), dry skin (42%), constipation (41%), arthralgia (32%), nausea (28%), pyrexia (26%), peripheral neuropathy (24%), myalgia (24%), pain in extremity (23%), back pain (21%), diarrhea (20%). Post-marketing cases of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome have been reported.
OPTIC Post-Marketing Trial

ARIAD is currently enrolling patients in the OPTIC post-marketing trial of Iclusig (ponatinib) which is expected to inform the optimal dosing of Iclusig. This randomized, dose-ranging trial is enrolling patients with CP-CML who are resistant to at least two approved TKIs. Patients are randomized equally to receive once-daily administration of 45 mg (cohort A), 30 mg (cohort B) or 15 mg (cohort C) of ponatinib. Patients in cohorts A and B will have their daily dose reduced to 15 mg upon achievement of MCyR. The primary endpoint of the trial is MCyR by 12 months for each cohort. ARIAD expects initial data from the OPTIC trial to be submitted to the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting in 2017.

About Iclusig® (ponatinib) tablets
Iclusig is a kinase inhibitor. The primary target for Iclusig is BCR-ABL, an abnormal tyrosine kinase that is expressed in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Iclusig was designed using ARIAD's computational and structure-based drug-design platform specifically to inhibit the activity of BCR-ABL. Iclusig targets not only native BCR-ABL but also its isoforms that carry mutations that confer resistance to treatment, including the T315I mutation, which has been associated with resistance to other approved TKIs. Iclusig is approved in the U.S., EU, Australia, Switzerland, Israel, Canada and Japan.

In the U.S., Iclusig is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the:

Treatment of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) for whom no other tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is indicated.
Treatment of adult patients with T315I-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase) or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL.
Limitations of use:

Limitations of use: Iclusig is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Based on the Phase 2 48 mo. follow-up analysis (N=449), except where noted

IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATION, INCLUDING THE BOXED WARNING
WARNING: ARTERIAL OCCLUSION, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, HEART FAILURE, and HEPATOTOXICITY

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Arterial occlusion has occurred in at least 35% of Iclusig® (ponatinib)-treated patients including fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain, severe peripheral vascular disease, and the need for urgent revascularization procedures. Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients less than 50 years old, experienced these events. Interrupt or stop Iclusig immediately for arterial occlusion. A benefit-risk consideration should guide a decision to restart Iclusig.
Venous Thromboembolism has occurred in 6% of Iclusig-treated patients. Monitor for evidence of thromboembolism. Consider dose modification or discontinuation of Iclusig in patients who develop serious venous thromboembolism.
Heart Failure, including fatalities occurred in 9% of Iclusig treated patients. Monitor cardiac function. Interrupt or stop Iclusig for new or worsening heart failure.
Hepatotoxicity, liver failure and death have occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. Monitor hepatic function. Interrupt Iclusig if hepatotoxicity is suspected.
Warnings and Precautions

Arterial Occlusions: Arterial occlusions, including fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain, severe peripheral vascular disease have occurred in at least 35% of Iclusig-treated patients from the phase 1 and phase 2 trials. In the phase 2 trial, 33% (150/449) of Iclusig-treated patients experienced a cardiac vascular (21%), peripheral vascular (12%), or cerebrovascular (9%) arterial occlusive event; some patients experienced more than 1 type of event. Fatal and life-threatening events have occurred within 2 weeks of starting treatment, with doses as low as 15 mg per day. Iclusig can also cause recurrent or multi-site vascular occlusion. Patients have required revascularization procedures. The median time to onset of the first cardiac vascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular arterial occlusive events was 193, 526, and 478 days, respectively. Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, some age 50 years or younger, experienced these events. The most common risk factors observed with these events were hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and history of cardiac disease. Arterial occlusive events were more frequent with increasing age and in patients with a history of ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia. In patients suspected of developing arterial occlusive events, interrupt or stop Iclusig.

Venous Thromboembolism: Venous thromboembolic events occurred in 6% (25/449) of Iclusig-treated patients with an incidence rate of 5% (13/270 CP-CML), 4% (3/85 AP-CML), 10% (6/62 BP-CML) and 9% (3/32 Ph+ ALL). Events included: deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, superficial thrombophlebitis, and retinal vein thrombosis with vision loss. Consider dose modification or discontinuation of Iclusig in patients who develop serious venous thromboembolism.

Heart Failure: Fatal or serious heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 6% of Iclusig-treated patients (29/449). Nine percent of patients (39/449) experienced any grade of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction. The most frequently reported heart failure events were congestive cardiac failure and decreased ejection fraction (14 patients each; 3%). Monitor patients for signs or symptoms consistent with heart failure and treat as clinically indicated, including interruption of Iclusig. Consider discontinuation if serious heart failure develops.

Hepatotoxicity: Iclusig can cause hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Fulminant hepatic failure leading to death occurred in a patient within one week of starting Iclusig. Two additional fatal cases of acute liver failure also occurred. The fatal cases occurred in patients with BP-CML or Ph+ ALL. Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in all disease cohorts, with 11% (50/449) experiencing grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity. The most common forms of hepatotoxicity were elevations of AST or ALT (54% all grades, 8% grade 3 or 4, 5% not reversed at last follow-up), bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Hepatotoxic events were observed in 29% of patients. The median time to onset of hepatotoxicity event was 3 months. Monitor liver function tests at baseline, then at least monthly or as clinically indicated. Interrupt, reduce or discontinue Iclusig as clinically indicated.

Hypertension: Treatment-emergent elevation of systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) occurred in 68% (306/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. Fifty-three patients (12%) experienced treatment-emergent symptomatic hypertension as a serious adverse reaction, including hypertensive crisis. Patients may require urgent clinical intervention for hypertension associated with confusion, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath. In patients with baseline systolic BP<140 mm Hg and baseline diastolic BP<90 mm Hg, 80% (229/285) experienced treatment-emergent hypertension; 44% (124/285) developed Stage 1 hypertension, 37% developed Stage 2 hypertension. In 132 patients with Stage 1 hypertension at baseline, 67% (88/132) developed Stage 2 hypertension. Monitor and manage blood pressure elevations during Iclusig use and treat hypertension to normalize blood pressure. Interrupt, dose reduce, or stop Iclusig if hypertension is not medically controlled. In the event of significant worsening, labile or treatment-resistant hypertension, interrupt treatment and consider evaluating for renal artery stenosis.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis occurred in 7% (31/449, 6% serious or grade 3/4) of Iclusig-treated patients. The incidence of treatment-emergent lipase elevation was 42% (16% grade 3 or greater). Pancreatitis resulted in discontinuation or treatment interruption in 6% of patients (26/449). The median time to onset of pancreatitis was 14 days. Twenty-three of the 31 cases of pancreatitis resolved within 2 weeks with dose interruption or reduction. Check serum lipase every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter or as clinically indicated. Consider additional serum lipase monitoring in patients with a history of pancreatitis or alcohol abuse. Dose interruption or reduction may be required. In cases where lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, interrupt treatment with Iclusig and evaluate patients for pancreatitis. Do not consider restarting Iclusig until patients have complete resolution of symptoms and lipase levels are less than 1.5 x ULN.

Increased Toxicity in Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase CML: In a prospective randomized clinical trial in the first-line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase (CP) CML, single agent Iclusig 45 mg once-daily increased the risk of serious adverse reactions 2-fold compared to single agent imatinib 400 mg once-daily. The median exposure to treatment was less than 6 months. The trial was halted for safety in October 2013. Arterial and venous thrombosis and occlusions occurred at least twice as frequently in the Iclusig arm compared to the imatinib arm. Compared to imatinib-treated patients, Iclusig-treated patients exhibited a greater incidence of myelosuppression, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, cardiac failure, hypertension, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Iclusig is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML.

Neuropathy: Peripheral and cranial neuropathy have occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. Overall, 20% (90/449) of Iclusig-treated patients experienced a peripheral neuropathy event of any grade (2%, grade 3/4). The most common peripheral neuropathies reported were paresthesia (5%, 23/449), neuropathy peripheral (4%, 19/449), hypoesthesia (3%, 15/449), dysgeusia (2%, 10/449), muscular weakness (2% 10/449) and hyperesthesia (1%, 5/449). Cranial neuropathy developed in 2% (10/449) of Iclusig-treated patients (<1%, 3/449 - grade 3/4). Of the patients who developed neuropathy, 26% (23/90) developed neuropathy during the first month of treatment. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain or weakness. Consider interrupting Iclusig and evaluate if neuropathy is suspected.

Ocular Toxicity: Serious ocular toxicities leading to blindness or blurred vision have occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. Retinal toxicities including macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal hemorrhage occurred in 2% of Iclusig-treated patients. Conjunctival irritation, corneal erosion or abrasion, dry eye, conjunctivitis, conjunctival hemorrhage, hyperaemia and edema or eye pain occurred in 14% of patients. Visual blurring occurred in 6% of patients. Other ocular toxicities include cataracts, periorbital edema, blepharitis, glaucoma, eyelid edema, ocular hyperaemia, iritis, iridocyclitis, and ulcerative keratitis. Conduct comprehensive eye exams at baseline and periodically during treatment.

Hemorrhage: Serious hemorrhage events including fatalities, occurred in 6% (28/449) of patients treated with Iclusig. Hemorrhage occurred in 28% (124/449) of patients. The incidence of serious bleeding events was higher in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage and subdural hematoma were the most commonly reported serious bleeding events occurring in 1% (4/449) each. Most hemorrhagic events, but not all, occurred in patients with grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Interrupt Iclusig for serious or severe hemorrhage and evaluate.

Fluid Retention: Fluid retention events judged as serious occurred in 4% (18/449) of patients treated with Iclusig. One instance of brain edema was fatal. For fluid retention events occurring in >2% of the patients (treatment-emergent), serious cases included: pleural effusion (7/449, 2%), pericardial effusion (4/449, 1%), and edema peripheral (2/449, <1%).

In total, fluid retention occurred in 31% of the patients. The most common fluid retention events were peripheral edema (17%), pleural effusion (8%), pericardial effusion (4%) and peripheral swelling (3%).

Monitor patients for fluid retention and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt, reduce, or discontinue Iclusig as clinically indicated.

Cardiac arrhythmias: Arrhythmias occurred in 19% (86/449) of Iclusig-treated patients, of which 7% (33/449) were grade 3 or greater. Arrhythmia of ventricular origin was reported in 3% (3/86) of all arrhythmias, with one case being grade 3 or greater. Symptomatic bradyarrhythmias that led to pacemaker implantation occurred in 1% (3/449) of Iclusig-treated patients.

Atrial fibrillation was the most common arrhythmia and occurred in 7% (31/449) of patients, approximately half of which were grade 3 or 4. Other grade 3 or 4 arrhythmia events included syncope (9 patients; 2.0%), tachycardia and bradycardia (2 patients each 0.4%), and electrocardiogram QT prolonged, atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular block complete, cardio-respiratory arrest, loss of consciousness, and sinus node dysfunction (1 patient each 0.2%). For 27 patients, the event led to hospitalization.

In patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of slow heart rate (fainting, dizziness) or rapid heart rate (chest pain, palpitations or dizziness), interrupt Iclusig and evaluate.

Myelosuppression: Myelosuppression was reported as an adverse reaction in 59% (266/449) of Iclusig-treated patients and grade 3/4 myelosuppression occurred in 50% (226/449) of patients. The incidence of these events was greater in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL than in patients with CP-CML.
Severe myelosuppression (Grade 3 or 4) was observed early in treatment, with a median onset time of 1 month (range <1-40 months). Obtain complete blood counts every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and then monthly or as clinically indicated, and adjust the dose as recommended.

Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Two patients (<1%, one with AP-CML and one with BP-CML) treated with Iclusig developed serious tumor lysis syndrome. Hyperuricemia occurred in 7% (31/449) of patients. Due to the potential for tumor lysis syndrome in patients with advanced disease, ensure adequate hydration and treat high uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with Iclusig.

Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): Postmarketing cases of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS—also known as Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)) have been reported in Iclusig-treated patients. RPLS is a neurological disorder that can present with signs and symptoms such as seizure, headache, decreased alertness, altered mental functioning, vision loss, and other visual and neurological disturbances. Hypertension is often present and diagnosis is made with supportive findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. If RPLS is diagnosed, interrupt Iclusig treatment and resume treatment only once the event is resolved and if the benefit of continued treatment outweighs the risk of RPLS.

Compromised Wound Healing and Gastrointestinal Perforation: Since Iclusig may compromise wound healing, interrupt Iclusig for at least 1 week prior to major surgery. Serious gastrointestinal perforation (fistula) occurred in one patient 38 days post-cholecystectomy.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, Iclusig can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of ponatinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Iclusig and for 3 weeks after the last dose.

Most Common Adverse Reactions: Overall, the most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (≥20%) were abdominal pain, rash, constipation, headache, dry skin, fatigue, hypertension, pyrexia, arthralgia, nausea, diarrhea, lipase increased, vomiting, myalgia and pain in extremity. Hematologic adverse reactions included thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and leukopenia.

(NASDAQ: ARIA) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Iclusig® (ponatinib) full approval for the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) for whom no other tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is indicated; and for the treatment of adult patients with T315I-positive CML (chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase) or T315I positive Ph+ ALL. Iclusig was initially approved in December 2012 under the FDA’s accelerated approval program, which provides patients earlier access to promising new drugs that treat serious conditions based on a surrogate endpoint while the company conducts additional studies to confirm the drug’s clinical benefit. The therapy was granted the FDA’s orphan drug designation because it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition.  This full approval and label update is based on 48-month follow-up data (as of August 2015) from the pivotal Phase 2 PACE clinical trial of Iclusig in heavily pretreated patients with resistant or intolerant CML or Ph+ ALL. These data were presented at the 2016 meetings of the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the European Hematology Association (EHA).  “The data on Iclusig continue to show that with a minimum follow-up of 48 months, many chronic phase CML patients in the PACE trial have retained long-term cytogenetic and molecular responses,” stated Timothy P. Clackson, Ph.D., president of research and development and chief scientific officer at ARIAD. “We are pleased to have received full approval of this medicine that was discovered and developed by ARIAD scientists to address rare cancers for patients who may have no other targeted treatment option. With this label update we are also now able to communicate to physicians that patients have experienced deep responses on Iclusig, measured by major molecular response (MMR). We are continuing our efforts to understand the optimal Iclusig dose for patients with the OPTIC (Optimizing Ponatinib Treatment In CML) post-marketing study.”  “The longer follow up of the PACE study confirms the clinical benefit of ponatinib in this setting. We had learned from the initial report of the high response rate with ponatinib among CML patients with resistance or intolerance to prior therapies. The four-year follow-up and updated safety profile demonstrate durability of responses in this heavily pre-treated population. These results solidify ponatinib as an important and valuable treatment option for refractory patients with CML where no other TKI therapy is appropriate, including those who have the T315I mutation,” stated Jorge Cortes, M.D., professor and deputy chair, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and a leading investigator in the PACE trial.  “Prior to the approval of Iclusig, there were patients with CML for whom no targeted treatment was available, either because they had developed resistance mutations or intolerance to other approved treatments. For these patients, we now have a better understanding of the long-term treatment profile of Iclusig,” stated Greg Stephens, executive director of the National CML Society. “We have been impressed by the major molecular responses some patients have been able to achieve on Iclusig and by ARIAD’s commitment to supporting patient and caregiver needs.”  Four-Year PACE Trial Data Included in Labeling Update  The efficacy and safety of ponatinib in CML and Ph+ ALL patients resistant or intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib, or with the T315I mutation, were evaluated in the PACE trial. A total of 449 patients were treated with ponatinib at a starting dose of 45 mg/day. An estimated 93 percent of patients previously received two or more approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and 56 percent of all patients had received three or more approved TKIs. Enrollment in the PACE trial was completed in October 2011.  Updated data on CP-CML patients (n=270) from the ongoing trial indicate that with a minimum follow-up of 48 months (data as of August 3, 2015), 110 patients continued to receive ponatinib. Additional data for CP-CML patients include:  55 percent of CP-CML patients achieved major cytogenetic response (MCyR) (primary endpoint) at any time. The median duration of MCyR (range 2.7 to 50+ months) has not been reached. 39 percent of patients achieved a major molecular response (MMR) at any time. The median duration of MMR (range 1.7 to 50+ months) has not been reached. With four years of follow-up, 33 percent (150/449) of all patients experienced arterial occlusive events (AOE). Twenty-one percent of patients experienced cardiac vascular, 12 percent experienced peripheral vascular and 9 percent experienced cerebrovascular arterial occlusive events, with some patients experiencing more than one type of AOE. Twenty-two percent experienced arterial occlusive serious adverse reactions (12% cardiac vascular, 8% peripheral vascular and 7% cerebrovascular). Six percent of all patients experienced a venous thromboembolic event. The most common any-grade treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in ≥ 20 percent of CP-CML patients included hypertension (69%), rash (63%), abdominal pain (48%), fatigue (47%), headache (43%), arterial ischemia (42%), dry skin (42%), constipation (41%), arthralgia (32%), nausea (28%), pyrexia (26%), peripheral neuropathy (24%), myalgia (24%), pain in extremity (23%), back pain (21%), diarrhea (20%). Post-marketing cases of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome have been reported.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Based on the Phase 2 48 mo. follow-up analysis (N=449), except where noted  IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATION, INCLUDING THE BOXED WARNING WARNING: ARTERIAL OCCLUSION, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, HEART FAILURE, and HEPATOTOXICITY  See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  Arterial occlusion has occurred in at least 35% of Iclusig® (ponatinib)-treated patients including fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain, severe peripheral vascular disease, and the need for urgent revascularization procedures. Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients less than 50 years old, experienced these events. Interrupt or stop Iclusig immediately for arterial occlusion. A benefit-risk consideration should guide a decision to restart Iclusig. Venous Thromboembolism has occurred in 6% of Iclusig-treated patients. Monitor for evidence of thromboembolism. Consider dose modification or discontinuation of Iclusig in patients who develop serious venous thromboembolism. Heart Failure, including fatalities occurred in 9% of Iclusig treated patients. Monitor cardiac function. Interrupt or stop Iclusig for new or worsening heart failure. Hepatotoxicity, liver failure and death have occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. Monitor hepatic function. Interrupt Iclusig if hepatotoxicity is suspected. Warnings and Precautions  Arterial Occlusions: Arterial occlusions, including fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain, severe peripheral vascular disease have occurred in at least 35% of Iclusig-treated patients from the phase 1 and phase 2 trials. In the phase 2 trial, 33% (150/449) of Iclusig-treated patients experienced a cardiac vascular (21%), peripheral vascular (12%), or cerebrovascular (9%) arterial occlusive event; some patients experienced more than 1 type of event. Fatal and life-threatening events have occurred within 2 weeks of starting treatment, with doses as low as 15 mg per day. Iclusig can also cause recurrent or multi-site vascular occlusion. Patients have required revascularization procedures. The median time to onset of the first cardiac vascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular arterial occlusive events was 193, 526, and 478 days, respectively. Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, some age 50 years or younger, experienced these events. The most common risk factors observed with these events were hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and history of cardiac disease. Arterial occlusive events were more frequent with increasing age and in patients with a history of ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia. In patients suspected of developing arterial occlusive events, interrupt or stop Iclusig.  Venous Thromboembolism: Venous thromboembolic events occurred in 6% (25/449) of Iclusig-treated patients with an incidence rate of 5% (13/270 CP-CML), 4% (3/85 AP-CML), 10% (6/62 BP-CML) and 9% (3/32 Ph+ ALL). Events included: deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, superficial thrombophlebitis, and retinal vein thrombosis with vision loss. Consider dose modification or discontinuation of Iclusig in patients who develop serious venous thromboembolism.  Heart Failure: Fatal or serious heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 6% of Iclusig-treated patients (29/449). Nine percent of patients (39/449) experienced any grade of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction. The most frequently reported heart failure events were congestive cardiac failure and decreased ejection fraction (14 patients each; 3%). Monitor patients for signs or symptoms consistent with heart failure and treat as clinically indicated, including interruption of Iclusig. Consider discontinuation if serious heart failure develops.  Hepatotoxicity: Iclusig can cause hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Fulminant hepatic failure leading to death occurred in a patient within one week of starting Iclusig. Two additional fatal cases of acute liver failure also occurred. The fatal cases occurred in patients with BP-CML or Ph+ ALL. Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in all disease cohorts, with 11% (50/449) experiencing grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity. The most common forms of hepatotoxicity were elevations of AST or ALT (54% all grades, 8% grade 3 or 4, 5% not reversed at last follow-up), bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Hepatotoxic events were observed in 29% of patients. The median time to onset of hepatotoxicity event was 3 months. Monitor liver function tests at baseline, then at least monthly or as clinically indicated. Interrupt, reduce or discontinue Iclusig as clinically indicated.  Hypertension: Treatment-emergent elevation of systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) occurred in 68% (306/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. Fifty-three patients (12%) experienced treatment-emergent symptomatic hypertension as a serious adverse reaction, including hypertensive crisis. Patients may require urgent clinical intervention for hypertension associated with confusion, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath. In patients with baseline systolic BP<140 mm Hg and baseline diastolic BP<90 mm Hg, 80% (229/285) experienced treatment-emergent hypertension; 44% (124/285) developed Stage 1 hypertension, 37% developed Stage 2 hypertension. In 132 patients with Stage 1 hypertension at baseline, 67% (88/132) developed Stage 2 hypertension. Monitor and manage blood pressure elevations during Iclusig use and treat hypertension to normalize blood pressure. Interrupt, dose reduce, or stop Iclusig if hypertension is not medically controlled. In the event of significant worsening, labile or treatment-resistant hypertension, interrupt treatment and consider evaluating for renal artery stenosis.  Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis occurred in 7% (31/449, 6% serious or grade 3/4) of Iclusig-treated patients. The incidence of treatment-emergent lipase elevation was 42% (16% grade 3 or greater). Pancreatitis resulted in discontinuation or treatment interruption in 6% of patients (26/449). The median time to onset of pancreatitis was 14 days. Twenty-three of the 31 cases of pancreatitis resolved within 2 weeks with dose interruption or reduction. Check serum lipase every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter or as clinically indicated. Consider additional serum lipase monitoring in patients with a history of pancreatitis or alcohol abuse. Dose interruption or reduction may be required. In cases where lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, interrupt treatment with Iclusig and evaluate patients for pancreatitis. Do not consider restarting Iclusig until patients have complete resolution of symptoms and lipase levels are less than 1.5 x ULN.  Increased Toxicity in Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase CML: In a prospective randomized clinical trial in the first-line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase (CP) CML, single agent Iclusig 45 mg once-daily increased the risk of serious adverse reactions 2-fold compared to single agent imatinib 400 mg once-daily. The median exposure to treatment was less than 6 months. The trial was halted for safety in October 2013. Arterial and venous thrombosis and occlusions occurred at least twice as frequently in the Iclusig arm compared to the imatinib arm. Compared to imatinib-treated patients, Iclusig-treated patients exhibited a greater incidence of myelosuppression, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, cardiac failure, hypertension, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Iclusig is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML.  Neuropathy: Peripheral and cranial neuropathy have occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. Overall, 20% (90/449) of Iclusig-treated patients experienced a peripheral neuropathy event of any grade (2%, grade 3/4). The most common peripheral neuropathies reported were paresthesia (5%, 23/449), neuropathy peripheral (4%, 19/449), hypoesthesia (3%, 15/449), dysgeusia (2%, 10/449), muscular weakness (2% 10/449) and hyperesthesia (1%, 5/449). Cranial neuropathy developed in 2% (10/449) of Iclusig-treated patients (<1%, 3/449 - grade 3/4). Of the patients who developed neuropathy, 26% (23/90) developed neuropathy during the first month of treatment. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain or weakness. Consider interrupting Iclusig and evaluate if neuropathy is suspected.  Ocular Toxicity: Serious ocular toxicities leading to blindness or blurred vision have occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. Retinal toxicities including macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal hemorrhage occurred in 2% of Iclusig-treated patients. Conjunctival irritation, corneal erosion or abrasion, dry eye, conjunctivitis, conjunctival hemorrhage, hyperaemia and edema or eye pain occurred in 14% of patients. Visual blurring occurred in 6% of patients. Other ocular toxicities include cataracts, periorbital edema, blepharitis, glaucoma, eyelid edema, ocular hyperaemia, iritis, iridocyclitis, and ulcerative keratitis. Conduct comprehensive eye exams at baseline and periodically during treatment.  Hemorrhage: Serious hemorrhage events including fatalities, occurred in 6% (28/449) of patients treated with Iclusig. Hemorrhage occurred in 28% (124/449) of patients. The incidence of serious bleeding events was higher in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage and subdural hematoma were the most commonly reported serious bleeding events occurring in 1% (4/449) each. Most hemorrhagic events, but not all, occurred in patients with grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Interrupt Iclusig for serious or severe hemorrhage and evaluate.  Fluid Retention: Fluid retention events judged as serious occurred in 4% (18/449) of patients treated with Iclusig. One instance of brain edema was fatal. For fluid retention events occurring in >2% of the patients (treatment-emergent), serious cases included: pleural effusion (7/449, 2%), pericardial effusion (4/449, 1%), and edema peripheral (2/449, <1%).  In total, fluid retention occurred in 31% of the patients. The most common fluid retention events were peripheral edema (17%), pleural effusion (8%), pericardial effusion (4%) and peripheral swelling (3%).  Monitor patients for fluid retention and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt, reduce, or discontinue Iclusig as clinically indicated.  Cardiac arrhythmias: Arrhythmias occurred in 19% (86/449) of Iclusig-treated patients, of which 7% (33/449) were grade 3 or greater. Arrhythmia of ventricular origin was reported in 3% (3/86) of all arrhythmias, with one case being grade 3 or greater. Symptomatic bradyarrhythmias that led to pacemaker implantation occurred in 1% (3/449) of Iclusig-treated patients.  Atrial fibrillation was the most common arrhythmia and occurred in 7% (31/449) of patients, approximately half of which were grade 3 or 4. Other grade 3 or 4 arrhythmia events included syncope (9 patients; 2.0%), tachycardia and bradycardia (2 patients each 0.4%), and electrocardiogram QT prolonged, atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular block complete, cardio-respiratory arrest, loss of consciousness, and sinus node dysfunction (1 patient each 0.2%). For 27 patients, the event led to hospitalization.  In patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of slow heart rate (fainting, dizziness) or rapid heart rate (chest pain, palpitations or dizziness), interrupt Iclusig and evaluate.  Myelosuppression: Myelosuppression was reported as an adverse reaction in 59% (266/449) of Iclusig-treated patients and grade 3/4 myelosuppression occurred in 50% (226/449) of patients. The incidence of these events was greater in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL than in patients with CP-CML. Severe myelosuppression (Grade 3 or 4) was observed early in treatment, with a median onset time of 1 month (range <1-40 months). Obtain complete blood counts every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and then monthly or as clinically indicated, and adjust the dose as recommended.  Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Two patients (<1%, one with AP-CML and one with BP-CML) treated with Iclusig developed serious tumor lysis syndrome. Hyperuricemia occurred in 7% (31/449) of patients. Due to the potential for tumor lysis syndrome in patients with advanced disease, ensure adequate hydration and treat high uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with Iclusig.  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): Postmarketing cases of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS—also known as Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)) have been reported in Iclusig-treated patients. RPLS is a neurological disorder that can present with signs and symptoms such as seizure, headache, decreased alertness, altered mental functioning, vision loss, and other visual and neurological disturbances. Hypertension is often present and diagnosis is made with supportive findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. If RPLS is diagnosed, interrupt Iclusig treatment and resume treatment only once the event is resolved and if the benefit of continued treatment outweighs the risk of RPLS.  Compromised Wound Healing and Gastrointestinal Perforation: Since Iclusig may compromise wound healing, interrupt Iclusig for at least 1 week prior to major surgery. Serious gastrointestinal perforation (fistula) occurred in one patient 38 days post-cholecystectomy.  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, Iclusig can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of ponatinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Iclusig and for 3 weeks after the last dose.  Most Common Adverse Reactions: Overall, the most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (≥20%) were abdominal pain, rash, constipation, headache, dry skin, fatigue, hypertension, pyrexia, arthralgia, nausea, diarrhea, lipase increased, vomiting, myalgia and pain in extremity. Hematologic adverse reactions included thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and leukopenia.  Please see the full U.S. Prescribing Information for Iclusig, including the Boxed Warning.

   in Heart Failure Patients Using Effective Pacing

   DUBLIN - Nov. 14, 2016 - Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) has received U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the Claria MRI(TM) Quad
Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator (CRT-D) SureScan(TM)
device for patients with heart failure. The Claria MRI CRT-D is approved
for scanning in both 1.5 and 3 Tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) machines, and features EffectivCRT(TM), a new algorithm that
automatically tailors the therapy to individual patients by adjusting
pacing rates.

   ""Until now, CRT devices have shown only whether a pacing pulse was sent,
but we haven't been able to determine if that stimulation actually
improves the heart's pumping ability,"" said Suneet Mittal, M.D.,
director, Electrophysiology Laboratory, Arrhythmia Institute of the
Valley Health System, Ridgewood, N.J. ""With the Claria device,
physicians are now able to verify the effectiveness of left ventricular
pacing, which is especially beneficial for improving outcomes in
patients with atrial fibrillation, who have been difficult to treat
because this irregular and rapid heartbeat often interferes with the
delivery of effective CRT.""

   A large percentage of heart failure patients receiving cardiac
resynchronization therapy have atrial fibrillation (AF),(1) which can
significantly reduce patient response to CRT. The Claria device includes
the Medtronic-exclusive EffectivCRT Diagnostic, which automatically
determines the effectiveness of each left ventricular pace, and the
EffectivCRT during AF algorithm, which automatically adjusts pacing
rates during AF, without adversely affecting the average heart rate.

   Additional features on the Claria device include:


   -- The AdaptivCRT(TM) algorithm, which reduces a patient's odds of a 30-day

      heart failure readmission by 59 percent,2 and has demonstrated a 46
      percent reduction in AF risk compared to echo-optimized biventricular
      pacing.3

   -- VectorExpress(TM) 2.0,  an automated in-office test that reduces lead
      programing to two minutes,4 and reveals clinically actionable
information
      to help physicians select optimal pacing configurations for each
patient.

   -- Attain(TM) Perfoma(TM) MRI SureScan(TM) Quadripolar Leads, which include

      short bipolar spacing to reduce phrenic nerve stimulation occurrence,5
      steroid on all electrodes, and three shapes for varying patient
      anatomies.

   -- SureScan(TM) MR-conditional labeling for full-body scans without
      positioning restrictions. Medtronic now offers MR-conditional
pacemakers,
      implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), insertable cardiac
      monitors (ICMs) and CRT-Ds. Additionally, patients with certain existing

      defibrillation leads will be eligible for an MR-conditional ICD or
CRT-D,
      and thus able to access this important imaging technology.


   ""The Claria MRI CRT-D is our latest innovation to help improve patients'
response to CRT, establishing a new level of personalized care,"" said
David Steinhaus, M.D., vice president and general manager of the Heart
Failure business, and medical director for the Cardiac Rhythm and Heart
Failure division of Medtronic. ""And it further expands our
industry-leading MR-conditional portfolio of devices, which are helping
to improve the lives of more patients throughout the world.""

   In addition to introducing CRT to the worldwide marketplace nearly 20
years ago, and offering the first MR-conditional CRT-defibrillators in
the U.S., the Medtronic heart failure portfolio includes mechanical
circulatory support therapy and impactful heart failure diagnostics and
expert analysis through Medtronic Care Management Services.

   Medtronic also has submitted a Pre-Market Application (PMA) to the FDA
for Multiple Point Pacing, which, if approved, would be available with
the Claria MRI and Amplia MRI(TM) CRT-Ds. The Multiple Point Pacing
feature is not currently approved for commercial sale in the United
States.

   In collaboration with leading clinicians, researchers and scientists
worldwide, Medtronic offers the broadest range of innovative medical
technology for the interventional and surgical treatment of
cardiovascular disease and cardiac arrhythmias. The company strives to
offer products and services of the highest quality that deliver clinical
and economic value to healthcare consumers and providers around the

has issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the New Drug
Application (NDA) for Lutathera(R) for the treatment of
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) in adults.
  Similar to the DRL, the CRL refers to issues with the format, traceability,
uniformity, and completeness relating to the NETTER-1 and Erasmus clinical
datasets, which are precluding FDA reviewers from performing the required
independent analysis of these clinical studies. In addition, the CRL
requests subgroup analyses for gender, age and racial subgroups, as well as
other stratification factors and important disease characteristics. A safety
update on clinical and non-clinical studies, which is already in process,
was also requested in the CRL. Finally, the CRL noted that any observations
made during inspections of manufacturing facilities supporting the NDA need
to be resolved prior to approval of the NDA.
  No additional clinical studies were requested in the CRL and there were no
comments at this time on other sections of the NDA submission.
  ""We are pleased that the CRL reiterates the issues previously raised by the
DRL, and does not contain any other significant requirements,"" stated
Stefano Buono, Chief Executive Officer of AAA. ""Receiving the DRL in advance

(Nasdaq:CEMP), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing antibiotics to meet critical medical needs in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases, today announced that the company has received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relating to the company’s new drug applications (NDAs) for oral and intravenous solithromycin for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults.

The CRL states that the FDA cannot approve the NDAs in their present form and notes that additional clinical safety information and the satisfactory resolution of manufacturing facility inspection deficiencies are required before the NDAs may be approved.

The FDA did not request any further information on solithromycin efficacy for CABP in the CRL.

Based on their review of the NDAs, the CRL stated that the FDA determined the risk of hepatotoxicity had not been adequately characterized. The FDA noted the size of the safety database is limited to 920 patients who received solithromycin at the proposed dose and duration, and is too small to adequately characterize the nature and frequency of serious hepatic adverse effects.

To address this deficiency, the FDA is recommending a comparative study to evaluate the safety of solithromycin in patients with CABP. Specifically, the CRL recommends that Cempra consider a study of approximately 9,000 patients exposed to solithromycin to enable exclusion of serious drug induced liver injury (DILI) events occurring at a rate of approximately 1:3000 with a 95 percent probability.

The CRL noted that while the FDA reserves comment on the proposed labeling until the NDAs are otherwise adequate, even in the absence of a case of Hy’s Law or of another form of serious DILI in future studies, labeling will need to include adequate information about the potential for hepatotoxicity, limiting use to patients who have limited therapeutic options and limitations regarding duration of therapy. A comprehensive plan for post-marketing safety assessment including an enhanced pharmacovigilance program would also be required.

The CRL also stated that during recent inspections of the Wockhardt Limited and Hospira, Inc. manufacturing facilities, the FDA field investigator conveyed deficiencies to representatives of the facilities. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required prior to approval.  Details on these deficiencies were not provided in the CRL.

Cempra plans to request a meeting with the FDA as soon as possible to discuss the issues identified in the CRL, including the design of the recommended clinical safety study and the steps necessary to resolve the deficiencies noted at Wockhardt and Hospira.  The company also plans to provide the FDA with an update on manufacturing progress at Uquifia, an alternate GMP manufacturing facility for solithromycin active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).

“As the rates of antibiotic resistance continue to rise, there is an unmet medical need for new antibiotics to treat patients with CABP and Cempra is committed to working with the FDA to achieve the approval of solithromycin as quickly as possible,” said David Zaccardelli, Pharm.D. acting chief executive officer of Cempra.

“With more than $225 million of cash on hand, patent protection for solithromycin through 2032 and a pipeline that includes fusidic acid and other potential programs for solithromycin, including an ophthalmic formulation, we have flexibility to determine the best course forward for solithromycin and Cempra,” Zaccardelli added.","CHAPEL HILL, N.C., Dec. 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cempra, Inc. (Nasdaq:CEMP), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing antibiotics to meet critical medical needs in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases, today announced that the company has received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relating to the company’s new drug applications (NDAs) for oral and intravenous solithromycin for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults.  The CRL states that the FDA cannot approve the NDAs in their present form and notes that additional clinical safety information and the satisfactory resolution of manufacturing facility inspection deficiencies are required before the NDAs may be approved.  The FDA did not request any further information on solithromycin efficacy for CABP in the CRL.  Based on their review of the NDAs, the CRL stated that the FDA determined the risk of hepatotoxicity had not been adequately characterized. The FDA noted the size of the safety database is limited to 920 patients who received solithromycin at the proposed dose and duration, and is too small to adequately characterize the nature and frequency of serious hepatic adverse effects.  To address this deficiency, the FDA is recommending a comparative study to evaluate the safety of solithromycin in patients with CABP. Specifically, the CRL recommends that Cempra consider a study of approximately 9,000 patients exposed to solithromycin to enable exclusion of serious drug induced liver injury (DILI) events occurring at a rate of approximately 1:3000 with a 95 percent probability.  The CRL noted that while the FDA reserves comment on the proposed labeling until the NDAs are otherwise adequate, even in the absence of a case of Hy’s Law or of another form of serious DILI in future studies, labeling will need to include adequate information about the potential for hepatotoxicity, limiting use to patients who have limited therapeutic options and limitations regarding duration of therapy. A comprehensive plan for post-marketing safety assessment including an enhanced pharmacovigilance program would also be required.  The CRL also stated that during recent inspections of the Wockhardt Limited and Hospira, Inc. manufacturing facilities, the FDA field investigator conveyed deficiencies to representatives of the facilities. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required prior to approval.  Details on these deficiencies were not provided in the CRL.  Cempra plans to request a meeting with the FDA as soon as possible to discuss the issues identified in the CRL, including the design of the recommended clinical safety study and the steps necessary to resolve the deficiencies noted at Wockhardt and Hospira.

- SPINRAZA Improved Motor Function in Patients with SMA; Greater Percentage of Infantile-Onset Patients on SPINRAZA Survived -

- FDA Approval Received Within 3 Months of Regulatory Filing - CARLSBAD, Calif., Dec. 23, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: IONS) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved SPINRAZATM (nusinersen) under Priority Review for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in pediatric and adult patients.  SPINRAZA is the first and only treatment approved in the U.S. for SMA, a leading genetic cause of death in infants and toddlers that is marked by progressive, debilitating muscle weakness.  SPINRAZA was discovered and developed by Ionis and Biogen, and licensed to Biogen who is responsible for future development, manufacturing, and commercialization of SPINRAZA. In ENDEAR, a pivotal controlled clinical study, infantile-onset SMA patients treated with SPINRAZA achieved and sustained clinically meaningful improvement in motor function compared to untreated study participants. In addition, a greater percentage of patients on SPINRAZA survived compared to untreated patients. In open-label studies, some patients achieved milestones such as ability to sit unassisted, stand or walk when they would otherwise be unexpected to do so and maintained milestones at ages when they would be expected to be lost. The overall findings of these studies support the effectiveness of SPINRAZA across the range of SMA patients, and appear to support the early initiation of treatment. 

""At Ionis, we have had the privilege of discovering and, together with Biogen, developing SPINRAZA. We are very pleased with today's announcement, which is an important milestone for the entire SMA community.  Now we look forward to the benefit that SPINRAZA can bring to patients with SMA and their families.  SPINRAZA is truly a precision medicine that works by altering the processing of a single cellular RNA.  We are proud that SPINRAZA exists because Ionis created and validated a new platform for drug discovery, antisense technology,"" said Stanley T. Crooke, M.D., Ph.D., chief executive officer and chairman of Ionis. ""We want to thank the families, physicians and their staff who participated in our clinical trials. Their dedication and support have been crucial to the approval of SPINRAZA for all those with SMA.""

The FDA approval of SPINRAZA was based on positive results from multiple clinical studies in more than 170 patients.  Ionis and Biogen conducted an innovative clinical development program that moved SPINRAZA from its first dose in humans in 2011 to its first regulatory approval in five years.  The data package included the interim analysis of ENDEAR, a Phase 3 controlled study evaluating SPINRAZA in patients with infantile-onset SMA, as well as open-label data in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic patients with SMA, or likely to develop, Types 1, 2 and 3 SMA. 

""I believe SPINRAZA is a game changer for patients with SMA and their families,"" said John Day, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Neuromuscular Disorders Clinic at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford and professor of neurology and pediatrics at the Stanford University School of Medicine.  ""Until now we had to tell parents that the only treatment was to manage symptoms as their children became weaker.  Now, SPINRAZA offers patients currently living with SMA hope for disease stabilization or improvement, and it raises the possibility that infants with SMA could be prevented from developing weakness if identified early enough.  More generally, the success of SPINRAZA increases our optimism that antisense oligonucleotides could also control other neurodegenerative disorders.""

""This is a watershed moment for the entire SMA community, which has worked tirelessly to finally see the day when a therapy for SMA would be made available.  Cure SMA and our families have supported research into this terrible disease for more than 30 years, and many have participated in the critical clinical trials for SPINRAZA. We are excited to now have the first ever treatment option for SMA, and thank all our supporters and the dedicated researchers who made this possible,"" commented Kenneth Hobby, President, Cure SMA.

""SPINRAZA is the first of many antisense programs for neurological diseases in our discovery and clinical development pipeline with the potential to treat a variety of other severe neurological diseases that are not adequately addressed today,"" said C. Frank Bennett, Ph.D., senior vice president of research and leader of the neurological disease franchise at Ionis.  ""We are excited by the potential of our antisense technology to treat diseases that other therapeutic modalities are unable to address or adequately treat.""

In conjunction with approval in the U.S., Ionis earned a $60 million milestone payment from Biogen and is eligible to receive $90 million in additional milestone payments based on regulatory approvals in Europe and Japan.  Ionis is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of SPINRAZA up to a percentage in the mid-teens. To date, Ionis has earned nearly $320 million from Biogen related to SPINRAZA.

Biogen plans to make SPINRAZA available for shipment in the U.S. to healthcare providers in approximately one week. Biogen anticipates there may be variation in time to treatment as institutions and treatment centers learn about SPINRAZA. Biogen also plans to present results from the interim analysis of the Phase 3 ENDEAR study at the British Pediatric Neurology Association conference being held in Cambridge, UK January 11-13, 2017.

""We are pleased with Biogen's preparations for launch and the speed with which they are implementing them,"" said B. Lynne Parshall, chief operating officer of Ionis. ""We look forward to receiving the first commercial revenues from sales of SPINRAZA next year.  These revenues will build on our current solid financial foundation and will add to the substantial revenues we expect to receive from our successful collaborations with Biogen and our other collaboration partners.""  

SPINRAZA (nusinersen) is under regulatory review with the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which has validated Biogen's Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) and granted Accelerated Assessment status. Biogen has also submitted regulatory filings in Japan, Canada and Australia and is initiating regulatory filings in additional countries in 2017.

About SMA
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. Ultimately, individuals with the most severe type of SMA can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing.

Due to a loss of, or defect in the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons. The severity of SMA correlates with the amount of SMN protein. People with Type 1 SMA, the most severe life-threatening form, produce very little SMN protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support or live beyond 2 years without respiratory support. People with Type 2 and Type 3 produce greater amounts of SMN protein and have less severe, but still life-altering forms of SMA.

SPINRAZA is the only approved treatment for SMA.

ABOUT SPINRAZA (nusinersen)
SPINRAZA is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that is designed to treat SMA caused by mutations in the chromosome 5q that leads to SMN protein deficiency. It was discovered and co-developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, a leader in antisense therapeutics, and Biogen. SPINRAZA is designed to selectively bind to and alter the splicing of a single RNA from the SMN2 gene, a gene that is nearly identical to SMN1, in order to increase production of full length SMN protein.  ASOs are short synthetic strings of nucleotides designed to selectively bind to target RNA and regulate gene expression. Through use of this technology, SPINRAZA has the potential to increase the amount of functional SMN protein in infants and children with SMA.

SPINRAZA is administered via intrathecal injection, which delivers therapies directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the spinal cord, where motor neurons degenerate in patients with SMA due to insufficient levels of SMN protein.

The most common adverse reactions reported for SPINRAZA were upper respiratory infection, lower respiratory infection and constipation. Serious adverse reactions of atelectasis were more frequent in SPINRAZA-treated patients. Coagulation abnormalities and thrombocytopenia, including acute severe thrombocytopenia, have been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides. Renal toxicity, including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides. 

Both the U.S. and E.U. granted SPINRAZA Orphan Drug status. Additionally, both the U.S. and E.U. regulatory agencies granted special status to SPINRAZA, including Fast Track Designation and Priority Review in the U.S. and Accelerated Assessment status in the E.U.

Biogen exercised its option to worldwide rights to SPINRAZA in August 2016.

THE SPINRAZA PHASE 3 REGISTRATIONAL STUDY, ENDEAR 
ENDEAR was a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study in patients with infantile-onset (most likely to develop Type 1) SMA. At a planned interim analysis of ENDEAR, a greater percentage of infants treated with SPINRAZA achieved a motor milestone response compared to those who did not receive treatment (40% versus 0%; p<0.0001) as measured by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE). Additionally, a smaller percentage of patients on SPINRAZA died (23%) compared to untreated patients (43%).  Data from the other efficacy endpoints analyzed were consistently in favor of infants who received treatment.","- First Treatment Approved for SMA -  - SPINRAZA Improved Motor Function in Patients with SMA; Greater Percentage of Infantile-Onset Patients on SPINRAZA Survived -  - FDA Approval Received Within 3 Months of Regulatory Filing - CARLSBAD, Calif., Dec. 23, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

  MIAMI, Jan. 10, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Nasdaq:OPK) --OPKO Investee, Zebra
Biologics Inc., an emerging biotechnology company of which OPKO owns
approximately 28%, announced it has entered into a collaboration with AbbVie
to discover agonist antibody therapeutics for inflammatory diseases. Zebra
will use its novel and patented function based antibody discovery platform
to generate antibodies that activate biological pathways associated with
targets designated by AbbVie. Zebra and AbbVie will collaborate closely on
the identification and pre-clinical validation of candidates. AbbVie would
then be responsible for clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory
approval and world-wide commercialization.
  About Agonist Antibodies
  To date all clinically approved antibody therapeutics exert their effect by
blocking (antagonizing) signaling between ligands and receptors or by
neutralizing pathogens. Rare antibody molecules may also activate
biochemical pathways, although finding such ""agonist"" antibodies has proven
difficult. As demonstrated in key peer-reviewed publications, the recently
developed Zebra screening platform opens up a novel biological
function-based approach to screening very large combinatorial antibody or
other peptidic libraries for potent and highly selective agonist biologic
drugs.
  About Zebra Biologics
  Zebra is a privately held pre-clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. The
Company is pioneering the development of platform technologies that allow
cellular function-based screening for the discovery and selection of fully
human therapeutic biologics (antibodies, peptides or proteins) from
DNA-encoded combinatorial libraries of human antibodies, peptides or
""protein-in-proteins"". Applicable for lead discovery across all therapeutic
areas and all receptor classes, Zebra has optimized the platform for the
highly desirable feature of allowing selection of rare agonist antibodies
from very large combinatorial libraries.
  Zebra holds exclusive licenses from the The Scripps Research Institute to

(NASDAQ: IDXG), a company that provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services for evaluating risks of cancer, announced today that the Company has entered in to an Agreement with the Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) Association's Center for Clinical Effectiveness ""Evidence Street"", a program that, while not making coverage decisions, provides the Company with the opportunity to provide available evidence for its molecular Thyroid and Pancreas tests, to support further coverage determinations among Blue Cross Blue Shield and other health plans. Blue Cross Blue Shield's 36 independent plans and Companies account for approximately 106 million covered lives in the U.S.  

As part of the Agreement, Interpace will work with Evidence Street to develop the optimal ways for the Company to secure and preserve ongoing coverage for not only its currently marketed products but also for those tests in the pipeline being launched in the near future. All of Interpace's currently marketed products are covered regionally by Medicare and numerous commercial plans, including certain BCBS plans.  

While the BCBS plans apply numerous criteria in their evaluation of technologies, the two criteria most heavily weighted are clinical utility and patient outcomes.  The Company has conducted numerous studies for their products in both its Endocrine (Endo) franchise, i.e. ThyGenX® and ThyraMir®, and Gastrointestinal (GI) franchise including PancraGen® and BarreGen® for pancreatic and esophageal cancer respectively.  The data from these studies have been published in multiple peer-reviewed publications such as Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, American Journal of Gastroenterology, and Endoscopy.   These publications provide favorable conclusions regarding the clinical utility of the Company's molecular tests.  The ECRI Institute, another independent review organization, published a review of PancraGen in April 2016, in which it concluded ""PancraGen is more predictive of real life patient management than current guidelines."" 

Jack E. Stover, President and CEO of Interpace Diagnostics stated, ""We are excited about our evolving relationship with Blue Cross and Blue Shield's Evidence Street which, we believe, will help ensure that we continue to develop and provide the information and data necessary to support and secure broader based insurance coverage and reimbursement for all of our products.  This relationship is another important milestone in our reimbursement strategy and, when added to our recent AETNA insurance approval for ThyraMIR  and New York State approval to market ThyGenX, bodes well for our commercial prospects in 2017 and beyond.""

About Thyroid Nodules, ThyGenX and ThyraMIR testing

According to the American Thyroid Association, approximately 15% to 30% of the 525,000 thyroid fine needle aspirations (FNAs) performed on an annual basis in the U.S. are indeterminate for malignancy based on standard cytological evaluation, and thus are candidates for ThyGenX and ThyraMIR.

ThyGenX and ThyraMIR reflex testing yields high predictive value in determining the presence and absence of cancer in thyroid nodules.  The combination of both tests can improve risk stratification and surgical decision-making when standard cytopathology does not provide a clear diagnosis for the presence of cancer. 

ThyGenX utilizes state-of-the-art next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify more than 100 genetic alterations associated with papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas, the two most common forms of thyroid cancer. ThyraMIR is the first microRNA gene expression classifier.  MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that bind to messenger RNA and regulate expression of genes involved in human cancers, including every subtype of thyroid cancer. ThyraMIR measures the expression of 10 microRNAs.  Both ThyGenX and ThyraMIR are covered by both Medicare and Commercial insurers.  

About Pancreatic Cysts and PancraGEN

PancraGEN is a pancreatic cyst molecular test that, by using a small sample of pancreatic cyst fluid, can aid in pancreatic cancer risk assessment. PancraGEN is 90% accurate, according to clinical studies, enabling effective risk stratification of patients.  Pancreatic cancer is often difficult to diagnose in early stages and typically spreads rapidly with signs and symptoms appearing when the cancer is significantly advanced. Because of this, and that complete surgical removal of the pancreas is not possible, pancreatic cancer is considered a leading cause of cancer deaths.

About Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.

Interpace Diagnostics is a company that provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services for evaluating risk of cancer by leveraging the latest technology in personalized medicine for better patient diagnosis and management. The Company currently has three commercialized molecular tests; PancraGen for the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer from pancreatic cysts; ThyGenX, for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer from thyroid nodules utilizing a next generation sequencing assay and ThyraMIR, for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer from thyroid nodules utilizing a proprietary gene expression assay. Interpace Diagnostics' mission is to provide personalized medicine through molecular diagnostics and innovation to advance patient care based on rigorous science.

condition to the closing of the merger of Sub with and into the Company, with
the Company continuing as the surviving corporation, as contemplated by the
Merger Agreement: (i) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; and (ii) the closing of the purchase
and sale of substantially all of the assets of WFB pursuant to the Bank
Purchase Agreement. The Company, Parent and Capital One previously disclosed
that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions in the
applicable agreement, including the expiration or termination of the waiting
period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act, and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency approving Capital One's application under the

does not indicate that the FTC has concluded that the transaction raises
competition concerns. The ""second request"" reflects a determination by the
FTC that it requires additional information to assess the proposed
transaction. The FTC's ""second request"" has the effect of extending the
waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger until the 30th
day after substantial compliance by the Company and Parent with the ""second

terminated sooner by the FTC. The Company continues to work with Capital One

Additionally, following Lemelson's identification of multiple accounting violations and misrepresentations by Ligand earlier this year, including the company's overstating the value of certain deferred tax assets by approximately $27.5 million, misclassifying its debt, and abusing the variable interest entity standard, Lemelson said today that he filed a whistleblower report earlier this year with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), urging the SEC to evaluate whether these alleged abuses constitute violations of civil or criminal statutes.

billion to settle a set of high-profile mortgage-securities probes stemming
from the financial crisis, according to people familiar with the matter, a
number that would rank among the largest of what other banks have paid to
resolve similar claims and is well above what investors have been expecting.

     The figure is described by people close to the negotiations between
Deutsche Bank and the government as preliminary, and they said it came up in
discussions between the bank and government lawyers in recent days. It
hasn't been previously disclosed. Deutsche Bank is expected to push back
strongly against it, the people said, and it is far from clear what the
final outcome will be.
     It is also unclear how much of that amount is proposed to be paid in
cash, and how much could be in consumer relief, as past deals have been
structured.
     The Justice Department routinely opens high-stakes civil settlement talks
with a tough posture, posing higher numbers than it might expect eventually
to win, even from banks eager to close long-running probes, lawyers involved
in current and similar negotiations say.
     A Deutsche Bank spokesman responded to questions about a settlement by
pointing to a July filing saying that the bank had started negotiations with
the Justice Department.
     Deutsche Bank hasn't said what it has set aside in anticipation of a
settlement. The bank held EUR5.5 billion ($6.2 billion) in total litigation
reserves as of June 30, and said it expected to set aside more before the
end of the year.
     Privately, Deutsche Bank lawyers have suggested that the bank views
between $2 billion and $3 billion as a reasonable cost to close out the
Justice Department's mortgage-related probe quickly, according to people
familiar with internal bank discussions and signals communicated to
investors. One factor in Deutsche Bank executives' thinking is that the
lender already paid $1.9 billion in 2013 to settle some U.S. claims tied to
mortgage-backed securities, some of the people said.
     A hefty settlement would be bad news for a clutch of big European lenders
who also face potential penalties or litigation in connection with a U.S.
crackdown on the selling and packaging of residential mortgage-backed
securities before 2008.
     Big U.S. banks have paid multibillion-dollar settlements for allegedly
misleading investors about the quality of such securities. The largest so
far has been $16.65 billion paid by Bank of America Corp. in 2014. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. agreed in April to a $5 billion deal that included a $2.4
billion cash penalty plus a pledge of $1.8 billion to help struggling
borrowers and communities hard hit by the 2008 collapse in home prices.
     The banks have been accused of bundling poorly-underwritten home loans
and selling them as safer securities than they knew them to be, ultimately
helping to fuel a bubble in rising home prices and exacerbating the
consequences of the subsequent collapse.
     Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley together paid
more than $23 billion in penalties and consumer help to settle claims.
     In all of these settlements, the banks acknowledged improper behavior.
     The European banks that remain under investigation and could face
penalties besides Deutsche Bank, include Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse Group
AG, UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, according to bank
disclosures and people familiar with the matter. The banks haven't commented
on any potential settlements other than to say they are cooperating with the
investigations. Some have set aside money for mortgage investigations as
part of their broader legal provisions, without specifying allocations,
according to company filings.
     Lawyers working with various banks say they consider Deutsche Bank a test
case in this next round of anticipated settlements, which come at a
sensitive time for European banks already thin on capital and slogging
through job cuts and restructuring. Lawyers for both Deutsche Bank and
Barclays have met or are meeting with Justice Department officials this
month to discuss a potential pact, according to people familiar with the
talks. Some lawyers involved have expressed a desire to reach a deal by the
November presidential election, the people said.
     Barclays CEO Jes Staley and Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan have both said
they are eager to put big-ticket legal matters behind them.
     The apparent gulf between figures viewed as palatable to the bank and
those posed by Justice Department officials suggests negotiations could
still have a long way to go, and could ultimately lead to court battles, the
people said.
     Analysts have estimated Deutsche Bank alone might pay between $2 billion
and $5 billion, based on previous settlements with banks including Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank's relative size in the precrisis
market for packaging and selling residential-mortgage-backed securities.
     In June, Barclays banking analyst Jeremy Sigee estimated Deutsche Bank
might pay $4.5 billion, and Credit Suisse and UBS might each pay $2 billion.
He and other analysts have said settlements ultimately could push Deutsche
Bank and Credit Suisse toward capital hikes.
     Past settlements haven't always been tied directly to the size of the
business targeted. Citigroup, for example, paid a larger penalty than
expected based on its size in the market for residential-mortgage
securities. Officials said at the time it was commensurate with the strength
of evidence against the bank. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup
declined to comment.

  WILMINGTON, Del., Dec. 15, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InterDigital, Inc.
(NASDAQ:IDCC), a mobile technology research and development company, today
announced that it has updated its expectations for total fourth quarter 2016
revenue to be between $258 million and $268 million.
  ""After the expiration later this month of certain module license agreements
that overlap with the target markets of the Avanci IoT licensing platform,
we see our annual royalty platform as being in the range of $360 million to
$380 million,"" said Richard J. Brezski, CFO of InterDigital. ""In addition to
revenue guidance, we expect a sequential increase in operating expenses over
third quarter 2016 of between $14 million and $16 million, approximately $11
million of which is related to adjustments to compensation accrual rates
reflecting strong company financial performance. We do not believe these
increased expenses reflect structural changes that will impact our long-term
view of operating expenses.""
  ""Our focus during 2016 was to balance revenue growth with long-term revenue
stability. Having long-term agreements now in place with the top three
terminal unit manufacturers, we've achieved that goal,"" commented William J.
Merritt, President and CEO of InterDigital. ""With that strong and stable
platform in place, we're well-positioned to drive towards our goals of $500
million to $600 million in annual recurring revenue from our core terminal
unit licensing business and $75 million to $100 million from our IoT
business.""
  These updated revenue expectations are based on preliminary accounting
results that are subject to review and finalization.  In addition, this
revenue guidance is based primarily on royalty reports received and license
agreements signed to date, and does not include the potential impact of any
new agreements that may be signed, or any arbitration or dispute resolutions
that may occur, during the balance of fourth quarter 2016.

CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 04, 2017--
  Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) today announced that its comparable sales on an owned
plus licensed basis declined by 2.1 percent in the months of November and
December 2016 combined, compared to the same period last year. On an owned
basis, comparable sales declined by 2.7 percent in the combined
November/December period.
  (Editor's Note: Macy's, Inc. this afternoon also issued a separate news
release announcing actions to streamline its store portfolio, intensify cost
efficiency efforts and execute its real estate strategy.)
  ""While our sales trend is consistent with the lower end of our guidance, we
had anticipated sales would be stronger. We believe that our performance
during the holiday season reflects the broader challenges facing much of the
retail industry. We are pleased with the performance of our digital
business, with double-digit gains at both macys.com and bloomingdales.com;
however, store sales continued to be impacted by changing customer behavior.
Our apparel business, which includes women's, men's and children's,
performed well, with particular strength in active and cold-weather
merchandise. Sales were also strong in fine jewelry, as well as furniture
and bedding, reflecting the success of our initiatives in those categories.
However, ongoing weakness in handbags and watches negatively impacted our
results,"" said Terry J. Lundgren, Macy's, Inc. chairman and chief executive
officer.
  2016 Guidance
  Macy's, Inc. maintains its previously provided full-year sales guidance of a
2.5 percent to 3.0 percent decrease in comparable sales on an owned plus
licensed basis, and expects to come in at the lower end of that guidance,
with comparable sales on an owned basis to be approximately 50 basis points
lower.
  The company now expects full-year 2016 diluted earnings per share (excluding
asset impairment, restructuring, retirement settlement and other charges) to
be in a range of $2.95 to $3.10 (compared with previous guidance of $3.15 to
$3.40).

  All statements in this press release that are not statements of historical
fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon the
current beliefs and expectations of Macy's management and are subject to
significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially
from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements
contained in this release because of a variety of factors, including
conditions to, or changes in the timing of, proposed real estate and other
transactions, prevailing interest rates and non-recurring charges, store
closings, competitive pressures from specialty stores, general merchandise
stores, off-price and discount stores, manufacturers' outlets, the Internet,
mail-order catalogs and television shopping and general consumer spending
levels, including the impact of the availability and level of consumer debt,
the effect of weather and other factors identified in documents filed by the
company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

  MACY'S, INC.
  Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
  The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). However, management believes that
certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the Company's financial
information with additional useful information in evaluating operating
performance. Management believes that providing changes in comparable sales
on an owned plus licensed basis, which includes the impact of growth in
comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties supplementally to
its results of operations calculated in accordance with GAAP assists in
evaluating the Company's ability to generate sales growth, whether through
owned businesses or departments licensed to third parties, on a comparable
basis, and in evaluating the impact of changes in the manner in which
certain departments are operated. Management believes that excluding certain
items that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude from diluted
earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders provides useful
supplemental measures that assist in evaluating the Company's ability to
generate earnings and leverage sales and to more readily compare these
metrics between past and future periods. The reconciliation of the
forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure of changes in comparable sales on
an owned plus licensed basis to GAAP comparable sales (i.e., on an owned
basis) is in the same manner as illustrated below, where the impact of
growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties is the
only reconciling item. In addition, the Company does not provide the most
directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure of diluted earnings per
share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders because the timing and
amount of excluded items (e.g., asset impairment charges, retirement
settlement charges and other store closing related costs) are unreasonably
difficult to fully and accurately estimate.
  Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an
alternative or substitute for, the Company's financial results prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included
in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact
the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows and
should therefore be considered in assessing the Company's actual and future
financial condition and performance. Additionally, the amounts received by
the Company on account of sales of departments licensed to third parties are
limited to commissions received on such sales. The methods used by the
Company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ
significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar
measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may
not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.
  Change in Comparable Sales
  The following is a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of
changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis, to GAAP
comparable sales (i.e., on an owned basis), which the Company believes to be
the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Notes:

(2)    Represents the impact of including the sales of departments licensed to

       third parties occurring in stores in operation throughout the year
       presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales in
       the calculation of comparable sales. The Company licenses third parties

       to operate certain departments in its stores and online and receives
       commissions from these third parties based on a percentage of their net

       sales. In its financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP,
       the Company includes these commissions (rather than sales of the
       departments licensed to third parties) in its net sales. The Company
       does not, however, include any amounts in respect of licensed
       department sales (or any commissions earned on such sales) in its
       comparable sales in accordance with GAAP (i.e. on an owned basis). The
       Company believes that the amounts of commissions earned on sales of
       departments licensed to third parties are not material to its results
       of operations for the periods presented.

MENOMONEE FALLS, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 04, 2017--
  Kohl's Corporation (NYSE:KSS) today reported that its comparable sales
decreased 2.1 percent in the fiscal months of November and December 2016
combined, compared with the prior year period. Total sales for the combined
fiscal November and December period decreased 2.7 percent.
  ""Sales were volatile throughout the holiday season. Strong sales on Black
Friday and during the week before Christmas were offset by softness in early
November and December,"" said Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, chief executive
officer and president.
  From a line of business perspective, Men's, Home and Footwear were the
strongest categories while Accessories was the most challenging. On a
regional basis, the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast were the best
performing regions.
  Fourth Quarter Earnings Release and Conference Call
  On February 23, 2017, the Company will release its fourth quarter and fiscal
2016 results at 7:00 am ET and host its quarterly earnings conference call
at 8:30 am ET.
  Earnings Guidance
  The Company now expects its fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to be
$2.92 to $2.97 versus its previous guidance of $3.12 to $3.32 per diluted
share. Excluding impairments, store closing and other costs, fiscal 2016
diluted earnings per share is expected to be $3.60 to $3.65, down from the
Company's previously stated guidance of $3.80 to $4.00 per diluted share.
  The change in guidance is primarily a result of lower than planned sales for
the quarter. Gross margin is projected to be lower than plan due to the mix
and timing of the sales and the competitive promotional environment. SG&A
expenses are projected to be as planned. Inventories per store at the end of
the fourth quarter are projected to decrease from prior year levels in the
mid-to-high single digit range.

Total sales for the combined fiscal November and December period decreased 2.7 percent.   ""Sales were volatile throughout the holiday season. Strong sales on Black Friday and during the week before Christmas were offset by softness in early November and December,"" said Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, chief executive officer and president.   From a line of business perspective, Men's, Home and Footwear were the strongest categories while Accessories was the most challenging. On a regional basis, the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast were the best performing regions.   Fourth Quarter Earnings Release and Conference Call   On February 23, 2017, the Company will release its fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results at 7:00 am ET and host its quarterly earnings conference call at 8:30 am ET.   Earnings Guidance   The Company now expects its fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to be $2.92 to $2.97 versus its previous guidance of $3.12 to $3.32 per diluted share. Excluding impairments, store closing and other costs, fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share is expected to be $3.60 to $3.65, down from the Company's previously stated guidance of $3.80 to $4.00 per diluted share.   The change in guidance is primarily a result of lower than planned sales for the quarter. Gross margin is projected to be lower than plan due to the mix and timing of the sales and the competitive promotional environment. SG&A expenses are projected to be as planned. Inventories per store at the end of the fourth quarter are projected to decrease from prior year levels in the mid-to-high single digit range.

Rockoff

  Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC (JAZZ) is nearing a deal to buy Celator
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CPXX) for about $1.5 billion, a huge premium for a
company with a promising leukemia drug but no revenue.
  The deal could be announced as soon as Tuesday, according to people familiar
with the matter.
  Jazz would be shelling out roughly double Celator's market value of about
$740 million--a lofty premium even in biotechnology, where acquirers often
pay up for promising new treatments. Less than three months ago, Celator
announced positive results for a clinical trial of a leukemia drug.
  The therapy, Vyxeos, aims to treat a blood cancer known as acute myeloid
leukemia with two currently available drugs in a new formulation.
  In mid-March, Celator, of Ewing, N.J., released data indicating the drug
candidate prolonged the lives of patients. The news raised investors'
confidence that the compound would be approved, and Celator's share price
rose more than 400% in a single day.
  Celator subsequently sold new shares to raise money that it could use to
bring Vyxeos to market, if it is approved. But some analysts still
questioned whether the company, which doesn't have any revenue, would have
enough money to do that.
  Jazz has a market value of about $9 billion and had nearly $1 billon in cash
as of March 31. The company is headquartered in California but has a foreign
tax address, thanks to its 2012 acquisition of an Israeli drug company--a
so-called tax inversion that moved its legal home to Ireland.
  Such deals have been popular among drug companies, and many that struck them
around that time have since become voracious acquirers in the U.S.
  However, Jazz largely sat out the wave of consolidation in specialty
pharmaceuticals over the past two years. Its last major purchase was a 2014
deal for Gentium SpA, an Italian maker of drugs to treat rare diseases. Jazz
spent about $1 billion to acquire Gentium.
  But Wall Street has questioned what the company will do when its main
product, narcolepsy drug Xyrem, loses patent protection. Executives have
indicated they are interested in bulking up the company's portfolio of
cancer treatments, such as the one Celator is developing.
  Jazz already sells two drugs for cancer patients. One is Erwinaze, a
treatment for a blood cancer known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Jazz
recently began selling a new drug in the U.S., Defitelio, which treats a
rare but fatal complication of stem-cell transplants given to certain cancer
patients.
  Jazz shares are down about 15% over the past year, though they have
recovered somewhat from the broad selloff in pharmaceutical stocks last
summer. The company posted $1.3 billion in revenue last year, a 13% increase
over 2014.
  There's been a steady stream of deal making in biotech even as merger
activity amid big drug makers has slowed somewhat this year. Two weeks ago,
Pfizer Inc. (PFE) struck a $4.5 billion deal to buy Anacor Pharmaceuticals
Inc. (ANAC), which is currently seeking approval from the Food and Drug
Administration for an eczema treatment.

Rockoff
     Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. is in advanced talks to sell a
big stomach-drug business to Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. for about $10
billion, a move that could ease pressure on Valeant over its hefty debt
load.
     The companies could reach a deal for Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd., which
Valeant bought just a year-and-a-half ago, in the coming weeks, people
familiar with the matter said. The purchase price would include about $8.5
billion in cash and future royalty payments to Valeant, the people said.
There is no guarantee the companies will reach a deal and, indeed, there is
another unnamed potential bidder in the mix, according to a person familiar
with the matter.
     Should Valeant strike a deal, it would allow the company to largely pay
back its bank lenders, removing a big area of concern for investors ever
since the drugmaker became embroiled in an accounting scandal last year.
Valeant has told investors it would work to reduce its debt load, but the
company was expected to do so through a series of smaller steps.
     It would also likely allow Valeant's new chief executive, Joseph Papa, to
focus on rebuilding Valeant's core franchises in skin and eye drugs, which
include Bausch & Lomb brands, have been struggling.
     Salix makes treatments for stomach disorders like traveler's diarrhea and
irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS.
     For Takeda, the purchase would come after it lost out on earlier attempts
to buy Salix and deliver big-selling gastrointestinal drugs it has been
seeking to bolster its lineup of stomach remedies.

Inc., the struggling social-media service, people familiar with the matter
said.
     Twitter, with a stock-market value of nearly $20 billion, has also held
preliminary talks with Salesforce.com Inc., according to people familiar
with the matter.
     The sale process is in early stages and it is far from guaranteed that
anyone will end up buying Twitter.
     The takeover talks have been fueled by Twitter's sluggish growth in users
and revenue, perennial turnover among senior executives and a lack of
mission and business plan as focused as those of competitors like Facebook
Inc.
     Twitter shares rose 3.3% to $23.37 on Monday, after rising 21% on Friday
when news of Salesforce's interest emerged. Disney stock fell 1.4% to $91.96
a share on Monday.
     A Twitter acquisition would be Disney's biggest technology deal yet,
following recent investments in Hulu and Vice, among others.
     Recent moves by Twitter into streaming sports events online have
attracted the attention of Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger. In August,
the Burbank, Calif.,-based media giant said it was spending $1 billion for a
33% stake in BAMTech, a streaming-media company created by Major League
Baseball that Twitter is using to live stream sporting events.
     Since Disney owns ESPN, the media giant could view Twitter's
sports-programming efforts as creating a potential rival -- or, in the event
of a successful acquisition, it could be a source of technology that could
benefit ESPN as cord-cutting becomes more widespread.
     Mr. Iger offered a positive assessment of the BAMTech-Twitter partnership
in a question-and-answer session at an investor conference held by Goldman
Sachs earlier this month.
     ""I thought Twitter actually did a very good job,"" he said, referring to
one of the National Football League games that the site had hosted. ""That
platform was powered by BAMTech last week and will be, which I think says a
lot about that platform because it was very stable.""
     Disney's investment in BAMTech, which could eventually expand to a
majority stake, was seen by Wall Street as an olive branch after investor
concerns about slowing subscriber growth at the company's ESPN cable
channel.
     Mr. Iger described Twitter at the Goldman Sachs conference as a ""new
entrant"" in the arena of sports rights but also defended his own subsidiary.
""You have to think about monetization capabilities of these new entrants,""
he said. ""Nobody can monetize sports better than ESPN,"" he said.
     Twitter and Disney also have ties through Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who
has served on the media company's board since 2013. He has looked to Mr.
Iger as a mentor, especially as Mr. Dorsey has had to wade through the
diverse demands of the two companies he co-founded and runs: Twitter and
payment company Square. In an interview last year, Mr. Iger told The Wall
Street Journal he occasionally counsels the younger CEO on business matters.
""I am not involved in his businesses, so I am a good sounding board for
him,"" Mr. Iger said.
     Disney's potential interest in Twitter was reported earlier by Bloomberg.

     Disney has a mixed record when it comes to acquiring technology companies
-- all of which have been much smaller than Twitter.
     In 2014, it paid an initial $500 million for Maker Studios, an online
video producer popular among younger viewers finding their entertainment on
YouTube Inc. An additional $450 million was promised if Maker met certain
performance targets, but Disney ended up paying only $175 million, according
to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     Maker's CEO, Ynon Kreiz, left the company last year, and several other
high-ranking executives have departed since the Disney acquisition. Maker
announced it was laying off an unspecified number of workers earlier this
year.
     Not all Disney's tech acquisitions have been well-timed. Disney bought
the social-gaming company Playdom Inc. for $563 million in 2010, not long
before social games plummeted in popularity.
     Disney Interactive, the company's videogame and online-content division,
merged with Disney Consumer Products in 2015 following years of losses and
layoffs.
     It turned a corner to profitability following layoffs that eliminated a
quarter of its staff in 2014 and the launch of the ""Disney Infinity""
videogame. But in May, Disney announced it was booking a $147 million charge
and canceling the ""Infinity"" line, a move that cut between 250 and 300 jobs
and closed a studio in Utah.

     Salesforce shares fell 3.4% to $72.02. A tweet from the account of

     Twitter's struggles, alongside a deal-friendly climate in Silicon Valley,
have raised questions around Twitter's future as an independent public
company
     In the years since its November 2013 initial public offering, which was
priced at $26, Twitter has grappled with slow user expansion and shrinking
revenue growth. In its June quarter, Twitter reported 20% revenue growth,
its smallest gain to-date and eighth-straight period of declining growth.
     Since Chief Executive Jack Dorsey retook the helm in 2015, Twitter has
sought to reinvigorate its ads business around video and revive user growth
by making the short-messaging service he invented easier to use.
     Last October, the company released its Moments feature, which curates
tweets, photos and videos shared on the service around sporting events,
entertainment and breaking news, to help newcomers get pulled into the
service.
     Last week, Twitter introduced its first live-stream of a National
Football League game, with an average audience of 243,000 viewers a minute
watching the New York Jets beat the Buffalo Bills. Still, that paled in
comparison with the average of 15.4 million people who watched the game on
CBS and the NFL Network.
     The football game was one of the first major events for Twitter's
live-streaming strategy, the cornerstone of its plan to become the premier
destination for live events. Twitter is trying to appeal to advertisers by
capitalizing on its strength as a real-time service and the growing trend of
cord-cutting viewers. Twitter plans to also stream the presidential and vice
presidential debates.

Chairman and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said
Tuesday he would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 new jobs,
following a 45-minute private meeting with President elect Donald Trump.
     The Japanese billionaire, whose conglomerate controls Sprint Corp.,
announced his investment plans in the lobby of Trump Tower, though he didn't
provide details. Mr. Trump took credit for the investment, saying his
November victory spurred SoftBank's decision.
     In an interview, Mr. Son said the money will be coming from a $100
billion investment fund that he is setting up with Saudi Arabia's
sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners.
     SoftBank has made investments in the U.S. in the past, including paying
$22 billion for about 80% of Sprint in 2013. Last year, SoftBank also led a
$1 billion investment round in San Francisco-based online lender Social
Finance Inc.
     Mr. Son's initial plan was to merge Sprint with T-Mobile US Inc. to take
on market leaders AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., but he
abandoned the effort after regulators signaled they would reject the plan.
Some investors and analysts have said he could make another attempt after
the election and when a new chairman is appointed to the Federal
Communications Commission.
     On Tuesday, Mr. Son declined to comment about his current interest in
T-Mobile. Mr. Son said he had set up the meeting with Mr. Trump and that he
likes him ""very much.""
     Mr. Son, 59, is known as an ambitious investor and has a long history of
betting on tech and telecom ventures. Most recently, SoftBank bought U.K.
chip designer ARM Holdings PLC for $32 billion.
     Mr. Son also has a history of going straight to national leaders to talk
business. In September he met South Korean President Park Geun-hye and said
he intends to invest around five trillion won ($4.5 billion) in the
country's technology sector. He has also met Indian Prime Minister Narendra
Modi and pledged to spend billions on the nation's tech startups and
renewable energy projects.
     With the new $100 billion fund -- dubbed the SoftBank Vision Fund -- Mr.
Son plans to spend heavily in fields including the so-called Internet of
Things, artificial intelligence, deep learning and robotics. He has said he
wants to become the Warren Buffett of the tech industry.
     SoftBank plans to invest at least $25 billion over the next five years in
the fund, while Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund may contribute an
additional $45 billion over the same period as the fund's lead partner.

Mr. Trump took credit for the investment, saying his November victory spurred SoftBank's decision.      In an interview, Mr. Son said the money will be coming from a $100 billion investment fund that he is setting up with Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners.      SoftBank has made investments in the U.S. in the past, including paying $22 billion for about 80% of Sprint in 2013. Last year, SoftBank also led a $1 billion investment round in San Francisco-based online lender Social Finance Inc.      Mr. Son's initial plan was to merge Sprint with T-Mobile US Inc. to take on market leaders AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., but he abandoned the effort after regulators signaled they would reject the plan. Some investors and analysts have said he could make another attempt after the election and when a new chairman is appointed to the Federal Communications Commission.      On Tuesday, Mr. Son declined to comment about his current interest in T-Mobile. Mr. Son said he had set up the meeting with Mr. Trump and that he likes him ""very much.""      Mr. Son, 59, is known as an ambitious investor and has a long history of betting on tech and telecom ventures. Most recently, SoftBank bought U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings PLC for $32 billion.      Mr. Son also has a history of going straight to national leaders to talk business. In September he met South Korean President Park Geun-hye and said he intends to invest around five trillion won ($4.5 billion) in the country's technology sector. He has also met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and pledged to spend billions on the nation's tech startups and renewable energy projects.      With the new $100 billion fund -- dubbed the SoftBank Vision Fund -- Mr. Son plans to spend heavily in fields including the so-called Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, deep learning and robotics. He has said he wants to become the Warren Buffett of the tech industry.      SoftBank plans to invest at least $25 billion over the next five years in the fund, while Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund may contribute an additional $45 billion over the same period as the fund's lead partner. ",,

Shire plc (LSE: SHP, NASDAQ: SHPG) and Baxalta Incorporated (NYSE: BXLT) today announced that the boards of directors of both companies have reached an agreement under which Shire will combine with Baxalta. Under the agreement, Baxalta shareholders will receive $18.00 in cash and 0.1482 Shire ADS per Baxalta share.  Based on Shire's closing ADS price on January 8, 2016, this implies a total current value of $45.57 per Baxalta share, representing an aggregate consideration of approximately $32 billion. The exchange ratio is based on Shire's 30-day trading day volume weighted average ADS price of $199.03 as of January 8, 2016, which implies a total value of $47.50 per Baxalta share.

The value of the offer, as of Shire's January 8, 2016 closing ADS price, represents a premium of approximately 37.5% to Baxalta's unaffected share price on August 3, 2015, the day prior to the public announcement of Shire's initial offer for Baxalta. This will provide Baxalta shareholders with approximately 34% ownership in the combined company. The parties expect the transaction to close mid-2016.

Shire Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov, M.D., M.P.H., commented:  

""This proposed combination allows us to realize our vision of building the leading biotechnology company focused on rare diseases. Together, we will have leadership positions in multiple, high-value franchises and become the clear partner of choice in rare diseases. Our expanded portfolio and presence in more than 100 countries will drive our growth to over $20 billion in anticipated annual revenues by 2020. Our due diligence has reinforced our belief in the combination, and we look forward to welcoming Baxalta colleagues to a shared entrepreneurial, patient-driven culture.""  


Susan Kilsby, Chairman of Shire, commented:  

""Together, Shire and Baxalta create a platform for sustainable innovation, growth and value creation. Shire is an experienced and disciplined acquirer with a track record of delivering shareholder value. Stakeholders of both companies are expected to benefit from the enhanced growth prospects, superior operational scale and efficiency and the strong financial and organizational profile of the combined entity.""

Baxalta Chief Executive Officer Ludwig N. Hantson, Ph.D., commented:  

""Today's announcement marks a new path forward for our organization and is a testament to the significant progress we have made in achieving our strategic business priorities. This transaction presents a unique opportunity for Baxalta shareholders, who will receive substantial immediate value as well as an ongoing stake in a combined global leader in rare diseases with strong growth prospects. We bring to Shire a strong portfolio and pipeline of market-leading products, high-quality manufacturing capabilities and a talented global workforce that places patients at the center of everything we do. The combined organization will be well positioned to accelerate innovation and deliver enhanced value for all stakeholders.""

Wayne T. Hockmeyer, Ph.D., Chairman of Baxalta, commented:  

""We launched Baxalta to focus on purpose-driven performance, sustainable growth, and continuing our leadership in developing treatments for orphan and underserved diseases. While we have made great progress to date and have had a measurable impact across all our businesses, I look forward to joining the board of the combined company to help ensure that we infuse the best of both organizations and foster a new shared culture that has the resources, the passion, and the commitment to continue to make a meaningful difference in the lives of our patients and their families.""

Baxter International Chairman and Chief Executive Officer José E. Almeida commented:  

""Baxter fully supports the proposed combination of Shire and Baxalta, which will create a major biotechnology company and global leader in rare diseases. Baxter is pleased to support this value enhancing transaction.""

Shire will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, January 11, 2016 at 1:30 p.m. GMT / 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST. (Details below)

Combination Creates the Global Leader in Rare Diseases with a Sustainable Platform for Future Innovation, Growth and Value Creation  

The combination of Baxalta and Shire will create the number one rare diseases platform in revenue and pipeline depth, with best-in-class products in each of the following growing, multi-billion-dollar franchises: Hematology; Immunology; Neuroscience; Lysosomal Storage Diseases; Gastrointestinal / Endocrine; and Hereditary Angioedema (HAE).  The combined company will also possess a growing franchise in Oncology, with approved products and innovative compounds in development, as well as a robust late-stage Ophthalmics pipeline.

The combined portfolio will have an expanded range of therapeutic areas with more than 60 programs in development, including over 50 that will address rare diseases and the newly-approved Baxalta products ADYNOVATE, VONVENDI and OBIZUR. Shire anticipates more than 30 recent and planned product launches from the combined pipeline, contributing approximately $5 billion in annual revenues by 2020.

Further, the combined company will benefit from expanded geographic reach across more than 100 countries, with a high-quality commercial organization and world-class manufacturing operations. Through a balanced portfolio and expanded therapeutic expertise and capabilities, the combination will enhance revenue diversification and optionality for the business, while strong cash flows will increase financial and operational scale. In total, the proposed combination will create a sustainable platform for future innovation and growth, yielding projected near- and long-term value for shareholders.

Leading Franchises, Each with Best-in-Class Products and a Foundation for Sustained Category Leadership in Rare Diseases  

The portfolio will include over 20 leading brands and a robust pipeline of expected new product launches with complementary positions across growing multi-billion-dollar franchises:  

Hematology   

Baxalta has a well-established hematology portfolio based on its heritage and legacy of leadership in hemophilia. Baxalta offers a comprehensive portfolio of innovative therapeutics, including ADYNOVATE, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), PEGylated, an extended circulating half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for hemophilia A which was recently approved in the U.S., and is focused on introducing new treatments for hemophilia and other rare chronic bleeding disorders to further reduce patient burdens 


Immunology   

Baxalta is contributing the broadest portfolio of immunoglobulin (IG) products in the industry, most notably the recently launched HYQVIA, a next generation subcutaneous IG treatment for patients with primary immunodeficiency, as well as a pipeline of innovative products across a broad range of potential new indications 


Neuroscience   

Shire has over 20 years of experience in neuroscience with a strong, growing ADHD franchise and pipeline, including a new VYVANSE indication for adults with moderate-to-severe Binge Eating Disorder 


Lysosomal Storage Diseases  

Shire brings industry-leading capabilities in the development and commercialization of a wide range of therapies for multiple rare and devastating genetic diseases including: VPRIV for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease; ELAPRASE for patients with Hunter syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis II, MPS II); and REPLAGAL for long-term ERT in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease 


Gastrointestinal / Endocrine  

Shire's Gastrointestinal / Endocrine portfolio is built on the strength of its 5-ASA products, LIALDA, for the treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, and PENTASA, for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis, and recent additions of GATTEX/REVESTIVE, for adults with short bowel syndrome who are dependent on parenteral support, and NATPARA, as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism 


HAE  

Shire brings HAE leadership through its currently approved prophylactic and acute therapies, CINRYZE and FIRAZYR, respectively,  and-pending completion of the Dyax acquisition-a Phase 3, potentially transformative prophylactic therapy 


Ophthalmics   

Shire is focused on building franchise leadership in ophthalmology with the 2016 projected launch of Lifitegrast, contingent upon regulatory approval, for dry eye disease; SHP640 for infectious conjunctivitis entering Phase 3 trials in 2016, and SHP607 for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity, generating results from its Phase 2 trials which are expected in 2016 


Oncology  

Baxalta brings a growing oncology business and a broad platform that positions the combined company at the leading-edge of discovery and development of innovative therapies in hematological and other cancers. The portfolio includes ONCASPAR (pegaspargase), a marketed biologic treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia, and late-stage, partnered products such as pacritinib, an investigational oral kinase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis, and ONIVYDE (irinotecan liposome injection) for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer   


Financial Highlights  

Shire anticipates that it will realize more than $500 million in annual cost synergies (expected to be achieved within the first three years post-closing). These annual cost synergies will be achieved by increasing efficiencies, leveraging the scale of the combined business, aligning to Shire's lean operating model and optimizing the combined R&D portfolio. Further, Shire expects to generate additional revenue synergies and a combined non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16-17% by 2017. Growth is expected to be accelerated by combining capabilities and establishing a global infrastructure that will include a ""best of both"" commercial model and a presence in over 100 global markets.

The transaction is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP diluted EPS in 2017, the first calendar year of ownership, and beyond. The combined company is expected to generate annual operating cash flow of $6.0 billion beginning in 2018, underpinning an attractive ROIC that will exceed Shire's cost of capital in 2020.

Shire has conducted additional tax due diligence, and based on this diligence, Shire and its tax advisor have concluded that a merger with the proposed cash consideration of $18 per Baxalta share will maintain the tax-free status of the Baxalta spinoff from Baxter.

Shire has secured an $18 billion fully underwritten bank facility to finance the combination. The new bank facility has a one year life, with a one-year extension available at Shire's option.  Shire intends to refinance the bank facility through capital market debt issuances in due course. The financing of the transaction has been structured with the intention of maintaining an investment grade credit rating for the combined entity. Shire is committed to de-levering rapidly post-close by deploying free cash flow to repay debt. Shire is targeting a net debt to EBITDA range of between 2.0x and 3.0x 12-18 months post-closing.

(Details below)  Combination Creates the Global Leader in Rare Diseases with a Sustainable Platform for Future Innovation, Growth and Value Creation    The combination of Baxalta and Shire will create the number one rare diseases platform in revenue and pipeline depth, with best-in-class products in each of the following growing, multi-billion-dollar franchises: Hematology; Immunology; Neuroscience; Lysosomal Storage Diseases; Gastrointestinal / Endocrine; and Hereditary Angioedema (HAE).  The combined company will also possess a growing franchise in Oncology, with approved products and innovative compounds in development, as well as a robust late-stage Ophthalmics pipeline.  The combined portfolio will have an expanded range of therapeutic areas with more than 60 programs in development, including over 50 that will address rare diseases and the newly-approved Baxalta products ADYNOVATE, VONVENDI and OBIZUR. Shire anticipates more than 30 recent and planned product launches from the combined pipeline, contributing approximately $5 billion in annual revenues by 2020.  Further, the combined company will benefit from expanded geographic reach across more than 100 countries, with a high-quality commercial organization and world-class manufacturing operations. Through a balanced portfolio and expanded therapeutic expertise and capabilities, the combination will enhance revenue diversification and optionality for the business, while strong cash flows will increase financial and operational scale. In total, the proposed combination will create a sustainable platform for future innovation and growth, yielding projected near- and long-term value for shareholders.  Leading Franchises, Each with Best-in-Class Products and a Foundation for Sustained Category Leadership in Rare Diseases    The portfolio will include over 20 leading brands and a robust pipeline of expected new product launches with complementary positions across growing multi-billion-dollar franchises:    Hematology     Baxalta has a well-established hematology portfolio based on its heritage and legacy of leadership in hemophilia. Baxalta offers a comprehensive portfolio of innovative therapeutics, including ADYNOVATE, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), PEGylated, an extended circulating half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for hemophilia A which was recently approved in the U.S., and is focused on introducing new treatments for hemophilia and other rare chronic bleeding disorders to further reduce patient burdens    Immunology     Baxalta is contributing the broadest portfolio of immunoglobulin (IG) products in the industry, most notably the recently launched HYQVIA, a next generation subcutaneous IG treatment for patients with primary immunodeficiency, as well as a pipeline of innovative products across a broad range of potential new indications    Neuroscience     Shire has over 20 years of experience in neuroscience with a strong, growing ADHD franchise and pipeline, including a new VYVANSE indication for adults with moderate-to-severe Binge Eating Disorder    Lysosomal Storage Diseases    Shire brings industry-leading capabilities in the development and commercialization of a wide range of therapies for multiple rare and devastating genetic diseases including: VPRIV for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease; ELAPRASE for patients with Hunter syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis II, MPS II); and REPLAGAL for long-term ERT in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease    Gastrointestinal / Endocrine    Shire's Gastrointestinal / Endocrine portfolio is built on the strength of its 5-ASA products, LIALDA, for the treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, and PENTASA, for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis, and recent additions of GATTEX/REVESTIVE, for adults with short bowel syndrome who are dependent on parenteral support, and NATPARA, as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism    HAE    Shire brings HAE leadership through its currently approved prophylactic and acute therapies, CINRYZE and FIRAZYR, respectively,  and-pending completion of the Dyax acquisition-a Phase 3, potentially transformative prophylactic therapy    Ophthalmics     Shire is focused on building franchise leadership in ophthalmology with the 2016 projected launch of Lifitegrast, contingent upon regulatory approval, for dry eye disease; SHP640 for infectious conjunctivitis entering Phase 3 trials in 2016, and SHP607 for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity, generating results from its Phase 2 trials which are expected in 2016    Oncology    Baxalta brings a growing oncology business and a broad platform that positions the combined company at the leading-edge of discovery and development of innovative therapies in hematological and other cancers. The portfolio includes ONCASPAR (pegaspargase), a marketed biologic treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia, and late-stage, partnered products such as pacritinib, an investigational oral kinase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis, and ONIVYDE (irinotecan liposome injection) for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer      Financial Highlights    Shire anticipates that it will realize more than $500 million in annual cost synergies (expected to be achieved within the first three years post-closing). These annual cost synergies will be achieved by increasing efficiencies, leveraging the scale of the combined business, aligning to Shire's lean operating model and optimizing the combined R&D portfolio. Further, Shire expects to generate additional revenue synergies and a combined non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16-17% by 2017. Growth is expected to be accelerated by combining capabilities and establishing a global infrastructure that will include a ""best of both"" commercial model and a presence in over 100 global markets.  The transaction is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP diluted EPS in 2017, the first calendar year of ownership, and beyond. The combined company is expected to generate annual operating cash flow of $6.0 billion beginning in 2018, underpinning an attractive ROIC that will exceed Shire's cost of capital in 2020.  Shire has conducted additional tax due diligence, and based on this diligence, Shire and its tax advisor have concluded that a merger with the proposed cash consideration of $18 per Baxalta share will maintain the tax-free status of the Baxalta spinoff from Baxter.  Shire has secured an $18 billion fully underwritten bank facility to finance the combination. The new bank facility has a one year life, with a one-year extension available at Shire's option.  Shire intends to refinance the bank facility through capital market debt issuances in due course. The financing of the transaction has been structured with the intention of maintaining an investment grade credit rating for the combined entity. Shire is committed to de-levering rapidly post-close by deploying free cash flow to repay debt. Shire is targeting a net debt to EBITDA range of between 2.0x and 3.0x 12-18 months post-closing.  Transaction Details    Under the agreement, Baxalta shareholders will receive $18.00 in cash and 0.1482 Shire ADS per Baxalta share.  Based on Shire's closing ADS price on January 8, 2016, this implies a total current value of $45.57 per Baxalta share, representing an aggregate consideration of approximately $32 billion. The exchange ratio is based on Shire's 30-day trading day volume weighted average ADS price of $199.03 as of January 8, 2016, which implies a total value of $47.50 per Baxalta share.  The value of the offer as of Shire's January 8, 2016 closing ADS price represents a premium of approximately 37.5% to Baxalta's unaffected share price on August 3, 2015, the day prior to the public announcement of Shire's initial offer for Baxalta. This will provide Baxalta shareholders with approximately 34% ownership in the combined company.  Closing     The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both Shire and Baxalta. Closing of the transaction is subject to approval by Baxalta and Shire shareholders, certain regulatory approvals, redelivery of tax opinions delivered at signing and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is a class 1 transaction for Shire for the purposes of the UK Listing Rules requiring the approval of Shire shareholders.

  Point of Care Testing
  Point of care testing helps improve outcomes and increase the speed of care
by bringing the test results to the physician and patient's side in a matter
of minutes. The demand for point of care testing is accelerating as health
care providers and consumers look for better ways to get fast, accurate and
actionable information to guide decision-making. In fact, point of care
testing is a $5.5 billion segment and one of the fastest growing in vitro
diagnostics segments, in part because many health care systems are
increasing their reliance on these technologies to inform patient care
decisions because of their ease of use, speed and accuracy.
  About Alere
  Headquartered in Waltham, Mass., Alere is the global leader in point of care
diagnostics with annual sales of $2.5 billion. Alere delivered more than 1.4
billion tests at the point of care in 2015. Its fast, easy-to-use and
cost-effective tests are focused on the areas of infectious disease,
molecular, cardiometabolic and toxicology. In addition to tests for
infections such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and dengue that can benefit
people in remote care settings, Alere develops simple, rapid tests,
including Alere i, the first molecular CLIA-waived test for flu and strep,
that delivers results in under 15 minutes.
  About Abbott's Diagnostics Business
  Abbott is a global leader in in vitro diagnostics offering a broad portfolio
spanning immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, blood screening,

Cash offer of $9.50 per share
All equity transaction supported by well-capitalized consortium
Will continue to invest in strategic transformation, enhancing student outcomes and career relevant education for working adults
Apollo Education Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by a consortium of investors including The Vistria Group, LLC, funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE: APO), and Najafi Companies for $9.50 per share in cash for both Class A and B shares. The purchase price represents a premium of 30 percent over Apollo Education Group’s 30-day volume weighted average stock price for the period ended Feb. 5, 2016, and a 44 percent premium over the closing price on Jan. 8, 2016, immediately prior to the announcement that the Board of Directors was pursuing strategic alternatives. Tony Miller, Chief Operating Officer and Partner of The Vistria Group and former Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education, will become Chairman of the Apollo Education Group Board upon transaction close.

“The Apollo Education Group Board of Directors reviewed strategic alternatives and believes this transaction is in the best interest of all shareholders and strongly supports our transformation efforts,” said Greg Cappelli, Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Education Group. “This new structure will allow Apollo Education Group the flexibility and runway it needs to complete the transformational plan at University of Phoenix, which will enable us to serve our students more effectively during a period of unprecedented volatility within our industry. We will also continue to expand our international operations and remain committed to driving principles of operating excellence.”

“We are excited by the opportunity to build on the transformational work being done by the company,” said Miller. “For too long and too often, the private education industry has been characterized by inadequate student outcomes, overly aggressive marketing practices, and poor compliance. This doesn’t need to be the case. We are committed to accelerating and enhancing efforts to establish University of Phoenix as the leading provider of quality higher education for working adults and to continue supporting the organization’s commitment to operating in a manner consistent with the highest ethical standards.”

Miller was the Deputy Secretary and Chief Operating Officer at the U.S. Department of Education from 2009 to 2013. Miller oversaw day-to-day operations for a broad range of management, policy and program functions, spanning early childhood through post-secondary education.

Upon completion of the transaction, Apollo Education Group will be privately held and its affiliated institutions will remain subject to the same U.S. and international regulations and accreditation standards.

The agreement was approved by Apollo Education Group’s Board of Directors. The transaction is subject to financial, operational and customary closing conditions. It is also subject to regulatory conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart‐Scott‐Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and approvals, including by the U.S. Department of Education, the Higher Learning Commission and state regulatory and programmatic accreditation bodies.

(NYSE: IM) and Tianjin Tianhai Investment Company, Ltd. (Tianjin Tianhai) (SSE A Share: 600751 and SSE B Share: 900938) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Tianjin Tianhai will acquire Ingram Micro for $38.90 per share in an all-cash transaction with an equity value of approximately $6.0 billion. Upon close of the merger, Ingram Micro will become a part of HNA Group, a Hainan-based Fortune Global 500 enterprise group and a leader in aviation, tourism and logistics and the largest stockholder of Tianjin Tianhai. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by both Ingram Micro's and Tianjin Tianhai's boards of directors, represents a premium of approximately 39% over the average closing share price of Ingram Micro for the 30 trading days ended February 16, 2016.

Following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2016, Ingram Micro will operate as a subsidiary of Tianjin Tianhai, consolidated under HNA Group, the largest stockholder of Tianjin Tianhai (via HNA Group's subsidiaries). Ingram Micro is expected to remain headquartered in Irvine, California, and Ingram Micro's executive management team will remain in place, with Alain Monié continuing to lead as CEO. All Ingram Micro lines of business and all regional and country operations are expected to continue unaffected.

Adam Tan, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO of HNA Group, said, ""Ingram Micro has clearly established itself as a leading distributor and global provider of IT products and services. The Company has a proven and talented team and we believe Ingram Micro is unrivaled in its ability to offer industry-leading, differentiated and easy-to-manage solutions to vendor and customer partners worldwide. We look forward to supporting Ingram Micro's management team and strategies, including continued expansion into new geographies, while also offering their vendor and customer partners access to new and complementary offerings. We share Ingram Micro's commitment to integrity, innovation and performance and we are confident this transaction will enable Ingram Micro to continue to distinguish itself in the marketplace and meet the needs of its vendor and customer partners better than ever before.""

Mr. Tan also said, ""After the transaction, Ingram Micro would become the largest member enterprise of HNA Group in terms of revenue, and facilitate the internationalization process of the group. With the help of Ingram Micro, HNA Group would have access to business opportunities in emerging markets, which have higher growth rates and better profitability. Furthermore, the addition of Ingram Micro would help the logistics sector of HNA Group transform from a logistics operator to a supply chain operator, and provide one-stop services while improving efficiencies.""

     Hospitality company SBE Entertainment Group has agreed to acquire Morgans
Hotel Group Co., according to people familiar with the matter, ending a long
saga in which the two companies have held on-and-off-again merger talks.
     SBE is paying $2.25 a share in cash for the outstanding shares of
Morgans, which were recently trading on the Nasdaq market at around $2.00,
though the shares were trading as low as $1.33 last week before jumping on
speculation of a takeover.
     The deal puts an equity value on the company of about $82 million, these
people said. The total enterprise value of the combined company, including
assumption of debt, would be about $800 million, say people familiar with
these companies' thinking.
     Private-equity investor Ronald Burkle's Yucaipa Cos.,which holds $75
million of preferred equity shares in Morgans and warrants for common
shares, will receive 25% of common equity in SBE, according to people close
to the deal.
     SBE Chief Executive Sam Nazarian, who founded the company in 2002, will
become CEO of the combined company and retain majority control. The Los
Angeles-based company is acquiring all the Morgans brands and ownership of
the Hudson and the Delano properties.
     Morgans owns or operates 13 boutique hotels, including New York's Hudson,
the Mondrian in Los Angeles and the Delano in Miami Beach. The combined
company will own or operate 20 hotels, including properties under the
flagship SLS brand. 
     SBE and Morgans held extensive merger discussions last year but those
talks collapsed in November after Mr. Burkle and Jason Kalisman, a Morgans
board member whose investment firm is the biggest shareholder, clashed over
terms of the deal.

  Stockholders to receive $14.00 per share in cash
  Transaction has total enterprise value of approximately $5.2 billion
  PR Newswire
  ALLENTOWN, Pa., June 3, 2016
  ALLENTOWN, Pa., June 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Talen Energy Corporation (NYSE:
TLN), a competitive energy and power generation company that owns or
controls 16,000 megawatts of capacity in eight states, announced today that
it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with affiliates of
Riverstone Holdings LLC (""Riverstone""), a private investment firm.
  Under terms of the merger agreement, all outstanding shares of Talen Energy
common stock not currently owned by Riverstone affiliated entities will be
acquired for $14.00 per share in cash. Affiliates of Riverstone currently
own approximately 35 percent of the outstanding shares of Talen Energy
common stock, which were issued in the June 2015 transaction that
established Talen Energy by combining competitive generation assets that had
been owned by affiliates of PPL Corporation and affiliates of Riverstone.
  The purchase price represents a 56 percent premium to the closing price of
$9.00 per share on March 31, 2016, the last trading day before public
reports of a potential sale of Talen Energy, and a 101 percent premium to
the 60-day volume-weighted average price of $6.95 per share through March
31.
  The transaction has a total enterprise value of approximately $5.2 billion.
  ""We believe the transaction offers compelling value to our stockholders,
while eliminating execution risk, and will provide additional momentum to
the outstanding work our employees have done to drive improvements in the
safety, reliability and efficiency of our plants in the time since we became
an independent company,"" said Paul Farr, Talen Energy President and Chief
Executive Officer.
  ""The disinterested directors of the Board, not including the two Riverstone
directors, with the assistance of our financial and legal advisors,
carefully analyzed Riverstone's offer, and after extensive negotiation and
thorough consideration, concluded that the agreement we are announcing today
is in the best interests of our stockholders,"" said Stuart E. Graham,
Chairman of Talen Energy's Board of Directors.
  David M. Leuschen and Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr., co-founders of Riverstone,
added, ""As an experienced owner of power generation assets, Riverstone is
excited to acquire Talen Energy and its world class generating fleet, which
is located in some of the United States' most attractive power markets.""
  'Go Shop'
  The agreement provides for a ""go-shop"" period, during which Talen Energy --
with the assistance of its legal and financial advisors -- may actively
solicit, receive, evaluate and potentially enter into negotiations with
parties that offer alternative proposals. The go-shop period is 40 days.
Talen Energy will be permitted to continue discussions with certain parties
that make a qualifying offer during the go-shop period for an additional 20
days and, subject to customary requirements included in the agreement, enter
into or recommend a transaction with a person or group that makes a superior
proposal. The agreement provides for the payment of a termination fee by
Talen Energy to Riverstone in the event that the agreement is terminated for
a superior proposal, which termination fee will be $50 million, but which
will be reduced to $25 million if Talen Energy accepts a superior proposal
made during the go-shop period.
  There can be no assurance that this process will result in a superior
proposal. Talen Energy does not intend to disclose developments during this
process unless and until the Board makes a decision with respect to any
superior proposal it may receive.
  Stockholder and Regulatory Approval
  In addition to approval by stockholders representing a majority of
outstanding shares of common stock, the transaction is subject to approval
by a majority of non- Riverstone affiliated stockholders voting at a special
stockholder meeting to be scheduled. Riverstone and its affiliates have
agreed to vote their 35 percent stake in favor of the proposed transaction.
  The transaction is subject to expiration of the applicable waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, approval of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
as well as certain other customary regulatory approvals and other customary
closing conditions. Riverstone's obligation to consummate the transaction is
also subject to Talen Energy having a minimum amount of cash and revolving
credit facility capacity available at closing.
  The parties currently expect the transaction to be completed by the end of
2016.
  Transaction Financing
  The consideration for the common stock in the transaction, of approximately
$1.8 billion, is expected to be funded by a conversion of Riverstone's
existing ownership of 35 percent of the common stock of Talen into shares of
the surviving corporation, Talen Energy's cash on hand, and proceeds of a
$250 million new secured term loan.  The new secured term loan is fully
committed by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays Bank
plc, Credit Suisse AG and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Morgan Stanley Senior
Funding Inc., and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., and will rank
pari-passu with the existing first lien revolving credit facility of Talen
Energy Supply LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Talen Energy) (""Energy
Supply""), which will be reduced from $1.85 billion to $1.4 billion upon
closing of the transaction. Concurrently with the signing of the merger
agreement, all of Energy Supply's subsidiaries that currently guarantee its
revolving credit facility have executed guarantees (effective as of the
closing of the transaction) of Talen Energy's outstanding unsecured notes
due 2025 (""2025 Notes"") and its Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing
Authority revenue bonds (""Municipal Bonds""), which together comprise
approximately $831 million of Energy Supply's approximately $3.3 billion
total unsecured debt that will remain outstanding. As a result of this new
credit support for the 2025 Notes and the Municipal Bonds, it is expected
that these notes and bonds will be structurally senior to the non-guaranteed
unsecured debt of Energy Supply, and we believe that the issue ratings on
the 2025 Notes and the Municipal Bonds will be maintained or improved.
  Financial and Legal Advisors
  Citi is serving as financial advisor to Talen Energy. Kirkland & Ellis LLP
is serving as Talen Energy's legal advisor. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and RBC
Capital Markets are serving as financial advisors to Riverstone. Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Vinson & Elkins LLP are serving as Riverstone's
legal advisors for the transaction.

Kirkland & Ellis LLP is serving as Talen Energy's legal advisor. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and RBC Capital Markets are serving as financial advisors to Riverstone. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Vinson & Elkins LLP are serving as Riverstone's legal advisors for the transaction.   About Talen Energy   Talen Energy is one of the largest competitive energy and power generation companies in North America.

(Envision) (NYSE:EVHC) and AMSURG Corp. (AMSURG) (NASDAQ:AMSG) today announced that they have signed a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which the companies will combine in an all-stock transaction at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.334 AMSURG shares per Envision share. The combined organization will have a pro forma market capitalization of approximately $10 billion and enterprise value of approximately $15 billion based on the closing stock prices of Envision and AMSURG on June 14, 2016. Envision shareholders will own approximately 53% percent and AMSURG shareholders will own approximately 47% percent of the combined organization on a fully diluted basis, including preferred shares. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies.

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160615006526/en/

Upon completion of the merger, which is expected to be tax-free to the shareholders of both organizations, the combined company will be named Envision Healthcare Corporation and co-headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee and Greenwood Village, Colorado. The Company’s common stock is expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol: EVHC.

The combination of Envision and AMSURG brings together two leading, complementary healthcare companies to form one of the nation’s largest provider organizations, well positioned to help shape the future of healthcare delivery. Together, the companies manage a broad continuum of clinical network solutions, including outsourced physician services in the following specialties: emergency, hospitalist, anesthesia, radiology and children’s services. In addition, the companies provide solutions for ambulatory surgery, post-acute care and medical transportation. The two companies had combined revenue of more than $8.5 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of more than $1.1 billion for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016.

Upon closing of the transaction, William A. Sanger, who serves currently as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Envision, will be Executive Chairman of the Board. Christopher A. Holden will be President and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company, the same positions he holds at AMSURG. Claire Gulmi, AMSURG’s Chief Financial Officer, will retain that role at the combined company; Randy Owen, Envision’s Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, will serve as President of Ambulatory Services at the combined company; and Robert Coward, current President of Sheridan and Chief Development Officer of AMSURG, will serve as President of Physician services. The newly formed Board will consist of 14 directors, comprised of equal numbers of current Envision and AMSURG directors, including Mr. Sanger and Mr. Holden.

Mr. Sanger said, “At Envision, we have been actively advancing our integrated delivery and market-centric strategies while AMSURG has been diversifying and building its national presence. Our two organizations complement each other in a way few others could, and this merger will accelerate our collective ability to positively impact healthcare delivery across the country. We are excited for the future and look forward to the opportunity to combine the resources of Envision and AMSURG.”

Mr. Holden added, “This merger will create a national platform with a highly differentiated suite of solutions. It will significantly increase our ability to empower physicians and expand our client relationships. Within a highly fragmented marketplace, we will have the critical first mover advantage to capitalize on the greenfield and cross-selling opportunities across our various offerings, and generate significant value for our shareholders.”

Compelling Strategic and Financial Rationale

Compelling client proposition with differentiated service offerings: The combined organization will have complementary strengths as a physician-led, patient-focused healthcare services organization with a broad national footprint. The Company’s platform of differentiated service offerings will span from pre-hospital, acute and outpatient care to post-acute care.
Well positioned for evolving healthcare environment: As a leader in each of its sub-specialties, the combined organization will be able to use its expansive network to improve patient outcomes and experiences while creating efficiencies through more effective care coordination.
Strong financial profile: The combined company will have a strong balance sheet with anticipated Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA at closing of 4.2x, including estimated contributions from recent acquisitions and estimated synergies. The Company will have a diversified business mix across verticals, geographies and clients, as well as significant cash-flow generation expected to be deployed for acquisitions, further driving growth while also reducing net leverage.
Meaningful synergy opportunities: The combination is expected to result in $100 million of synergies, anticipated to be fully realized within three years of closing. Synergies are expected to be derived through cost savings as well as meaningful revenue synergies from an enhanced portfolio and cross-selling opportunities.
Experienced, accomplished management team: The management team has a proven track record of building organizations for the changing healthcare environment and growth through both acquisitions and sales.
Significant accretion: The transaction is expected to be accretive to the two companies’ combined adjusted earnings per share in 2017 and double-digit accretive in 2018.

Bancorp is expected to be tax-free.

(“OceanFirst”) (NASDAQ:OCFC), headquartered in Toms River, New Jersey, and Ocean Shore Holding Co. (“Ocean Shore”) (NASDAQ:OSHC), headquartered in Ocean City, New Jersey, jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which Ocean Shore, the holding company and parent of Ocean City Home Bank, will merge with and into OceanFirst, the holding company and parent of OceanFirst Bank. Ocean City Home Bank will also merge with and into OceanFirst Bank. The transaction is valued at approximately $22.47 per Ocean Shore common share or approximately $145.6 million in the aggregate.

With roots dating back to 1887, Ocean City Home Bank is one of Southern New Jersey’s oldest and largest community banks with approximately $1.1 billion in total assets, $818 million in total deposits and $796 million in gross loans. Ocean Shore operates 11 full-service banking centers in Atlantic and Cape May Counties. Following OceanFirst’s recently completed acquisition of Cape Bancorp, Inc., the proposed transaction will further enrich OceanFirst’s distribution, scale and core deposit funding base, as it presents an exceptionally rare opportunity to combine two well-established, like-minded New Jersey franchises.

OceanFirst will strengthen its position as the largest bank headquartered in Central and Southern New Jersey and rank as the fourth largest New Jersey based banking institution by deposit market share.  Based on financial information as of March 31, 2016, and pro forma for the Cape transaction, the combined institution would have approximately $5.3 billion in total assets, $4.0 billion in total deposits, $4.0 billion in gross loans and 61 full-service banking locations.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, upon completion of the merger, shareholders of Ocean Shore common stock will be entitled to receive $4.35 in cash and 0.9667 shares of OceanFirst common stock for each share of Ocean Shore common stock. The transaction is expected to close late fourth quarter of 2016 or early first quarter of 2017, subject to each company receiving the required approval of its shareholders, receipt of all required regulatory approvals and fulfillment of other customary closing conditions.

The purchase price equates to 132% of Ocean Shore’s March 31, 2016 tangible book value, 4.9% premium to core deposits, 20.1x Ocean Shore’s trailing twelve month earnings, and 9.3x Ocean Shore’s estimated 2017 (forward) earnings (assuming fully phased-in cost savings). Tangible book value per common share is expected to be diluted by approximately 3.1% at closing with a projected earnback period of approximately 3.7 years using the cross-over1 method.

The transaction includes strong earnings per share accretion of approximately 5.4% in 2018 (the first full year of combined operations and synergies) in addition to the projected double-digit earnings accretion from the Cape Bancorp, Inc. transaction. The combined company will be structured to support enhanced financial return targets of greater than 1.05% return on average assets and greater than 13.0% return on average tangible common equity along with remaining “well-capitalized” under regulatory guidelines.

OceanFirst expects to incur pre-tax merger and integration costs of approximately $19 million and to achieve cost savings of approximately 53% of Ocean Shore’s non-interest expenses or $12.4 million if 2017 cost savings were to be fully phased in. 

“We are excited to welcome Ocean City Home Bank customers and employees to the OceanFirst family. Our two institutions have developed our respective community banks with a consistent vision, effectively sharing similar histories.  With our mutual understanding of our community bank business models and local market focus, OceanFirst and Ocean Shore can leverage this synergy to create one of the most highly valued banking institutions in the Mid-Atlantic region,” said Christopher D. Maher, President and Chief Executive Officer of OceanFirst.

Mr. Maher further commented, “This transaction represents a unique opportunity for OceanFirst to capitalize on its recent entry into Southern New Jersey through the acquisition of an extremely valuable deposit franchise coupled with significant efficiencies and low execution risk. Ocean Shore’s residential focus creates strategic optionality for prudent commercial real estate growth with strong cash flows.  We look forward to continuing to provide extraordinary customer care to all OceanFirst and Ocean Shore customers, as well as providing enhanced value to our stockholders.”

Steven E. Brady, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ocean Shore, echoed Mr. Maher’s comments stating, “The combination with OceanFirst provides several strategic benefits for all Ocean Shore stakeholders, including improved operating scale, access to additional product lines and increased shareholder liquidity.”  Mr. Brady added that “while this merger solidifies the pro forma bank’s Jersey Shore dominance, it also provides Ocean Shore the opportunity to capitalize on OceanFirst’s considerable expansion efforts toward the demographically attractive Philadelphia metro market - a natural market extension for Ocean Shore’s franchise as well.”

To provide for additional representation for OceanFirst’s Southern New Jersey market area, upon completion of the transaction, three current Ocean Shore Board members are expected to join the OceanFirst Board, including Mr. Brady.  Mr. Brady will also be named Vice Chairman for the Southern New Jersey Division, to serve in an advisory capacity for OceanFirst, where he will provide insight from his extensive banking and professional experience.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) and InterOil Corporation (NYSE: IOC, POMSoX: IOC) today announced an agreed transaction worth more than $2.5 billion, under which ExxonMobil will acquire all of the outstanding shares of InterOil (the ExxonMobil Transaction).

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160721006048/en/

“This agreement will enable ExxonMobil to create value for the shareholders of both companies and the people of Papua New Guinea,” said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation.

“InterOil’s resources will enhance ExxonMobil’s already successful business in Papua New Guinea and bolster the company’s strong position in liquefied natural gas.”

InterOil Chairman Chris Finlayson said, “Our board of directors thoroughly reviewed the ExxonMobil transaction and concluded that it delivers superior value to InterOil shareholders. They will also benefit from their interest in ExxonMobil’s diverse asset base and dividend stream.”

Under the terms of the agreement with ExxonMobil, InterOil shareholders will receive:

A payment of $45.00 per share of InterOil, paid in ExxonMobil shares, at closing. The number of ExxonMobil shares paid per share of InterOil will be calculated based on the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of ExxonMobil shares over a measuring period of 10 days ending shortly before the closing date (Share Consideration).
A Contingent Resource Payment (CRP), which will be an additional cash payment of $7.07 per share for each trillion cubic feet equivalent (tcfe) gross resource certification of the Elk-Antelope field above 6.2 tcfe, up to a maximum of 10 tcfe. The CRP will be paid on the completion of the interim certification process in accordance with the Share Purchase Agreement with Total SA, which will include the Antelope-7 appraisal well, scheduled to be drilled later in 2016. The CRP will not be transferrable and will not be listed on any exchange.
Together the Share Consideration and the CRP represent a material premium to the closing price of InterOil shares on May 19, 2016 -- the day prior to the announcement of the Oil Search transaction -- based on a range of Elk-Antelope resource estimates:

4
Based on InterOil’s 3-month VWAP up to and including May 19, 2016 of US$30.37 per share.
 
Compelling Benefits of the Transaction

When concluded, this transaction will give ExxonMobil access to InterOil’s resource base, which includes interests in six licenses in Papua New Guinea covering about four million acres, including PRL 15. The Elk-Antelope field in PRL 15 is the anchor field for the proposed Papua LNG project.

ExxonMobil’s more than 40 years of experience in the global LNG business enables it to efficiently link complex elements such as resource development, pipelines, liquefaction plants, shipping and regasification terminals, which it has demonstrated through the PNG LNG project, working closely with co-venturers, national, provincial and local governments, and local communities. ExxonMobil will bring to bear its industry-leading performance and strong commitment to excellence as it grows its business in Papua New Guinea.

The PNG LNG project, the first of its kind in the country, was developed by ExxonMobil in challenging conditions on budget and ahead of schedule and is now exceeding production design capacity, demonstrating the company’s leadership in project management and operations.

ExxonMobil will work with co-venturers and the government to evaluate processing of gas from the Elk-Antelope field by expanding the PNG LNG project. This would take advantage of synergies offered by expansion of an existing project to realize time and cost reductions that would benefit the PNG Treasury, the government’s holding in Oil Search, other shareholders and landowners.

Path to Completion

The ExxonMobil Transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies. The InterOil board unanimously recommends that InterOil shareholders approve the ExxonMobil Transaction.

The ExxonMobil Transaction will be implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Yukon) and will require the approval of at least 66 2/3 percent of the votes cast by InterOil shareholders at a special meeting expected to take place in September, 2016.

In addition to InterOil shareholder and court approvals, the ExxonMobil Transaction is also subject to other customary conditions. Subject to obtaining the aforementioned approvals and satisfaction of closing conditions, the ExxonMobil Transaction is expected to close in September, 2016.

Further information regarding the transaction with ExxonMobil will be included in an information circular, which will be mailed to InterOil shareholders in due course. Copies of the key transaction documents for the ExxonMobil Transaction (being the arrangement agreement and the information circular) will be available online under InterOil’s corporate profile at www.sedar.com.

Oil Search Transaction

The InterOil board of directors, in consultation with its independent legal and financial advisors, determined that the ExxonMobil Transaction is superior to the previously announced transaction with Oil Search Limited (ASX:OSH, POMSoX: OSH) and so advised Oil Search on July 18, 2016. Immediately prior to entering into the arrangement agreement with ExxonMobil, InterOil terminated its previously announced arrangement agreement with Oil Search, and ExxonMobil is paying Oil Search the termination fee in accordance with the requirements of the Oil Search arrangement agreement on behalf of InterOil. The previously scheduled Special Meeting of Shareholders to vote for the approval of the Oil Search transaction has been cancelled.

"RIG, RIGP",8/1/16,M/A,Late Stage,Fly On The Wall,S.FO HOTS.FLY RIG RIGP,Transocean to acquire Transocean Partners,"Transocean to acquire Transocean Partners   - Transocean (RIG) and Transocean
Partners (RIGP) announced that Transocean has agreed to acquire all of the
outstanding common units of Transocean Partners not already owned by
Transocean in a share-for-unit merger transaction. In the merger, Transocean
Partners common unitholders will receive 1.1427 Transocean shares for each
Transocean Partners common unit. The Transocean Partners unit price implied
by the exchange ratio represents a 15% premium to Transocean Partners'
closing price on July 29, 2016. Transocean expects to issue approximately
22.7M shares in the merger. Completion of the transaction is conditioned upon
approval by Transocean Partners' common unitholders and is anticipated to
close in the fourth quarter of 2016. Following completion of the transaction,
Transocean Partners will be 100% owned by Transocean and therefore Transocean
will have indirectly acquired the 51% ownership interests in the Discoverer
Inspiration, the Discoverer Clear Leader and the Development Driller III that
are currently owned by Transocean Partners. Additionally, Transocean
Partners' common units will cease to be publicly traded on the NYSE. The
transaction is subject to the approval of the holders of Transocean Partners'
common units pursuant to its limited liability company agreement. As
Transocean has already committed to voting its approximately 21.3M common

By Jenny Strasburg
     LONDON -- An investment firm formed by former executives of Deutsche Bank
AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has agreed to buy CIFC LLC, a publicly
traded credit-fund manager based in New York, for about $330 million in
cash, according to people familiar with the matter.
     The acquisition by newly formed F.A.B. Partners is expected to be
announced as soon as later Friday, the people said.
     CIFC, with a market value of about $160 million, specializes in
collateralized loan portfolios and is majority-owned by Columbus Nova, the
U.S. investment arm of the Renova Group, a Russian conglomerate. CIFC
manages about $14 billion in debt investments.
     The acquisition is the first deal by Jersey-based F.A.B. Partners, which
was set up in recent months by former Deutsche Bank executives Michele
Faissola and Nizar Al-Bassam, along with Dalinc Ariburnu, who most recently
was at Goldman Sachs.
     F.A.B. is backed in the transaction by Supreme Universal Holdings Ltd.,
an investment arm of the Qatari royal family, people familiar with the
matter said.
     F.A.B. aims to source and manage investments for clients including
high-net-worth families and sovereign-wealth funds, according to the
company's website. It has about a dozen clients, including the Qatari royal
family, one of the people said.
     Mr. Faissola left Deutsche Bank last year after overseeing its
global-asset and wealth-management business. Mr. Al-Bassam until earlier
this year oversaw Deutsche Bank's financing-solutions business for a large
part of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Mr. Ariburnu this year left
Goldman Sachs, where he was global co-head of sales for fixed income,

Cabela’s Shareholders Will Receive $65.50 Per Share in Cash

Bass Pro Shops Entering into Multi-Year Credit Card Partnership with Capital One

Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s Club Customer Loyalty Programs Remain Unchanged

Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s Incorporated (NYSE:CAB), two iconic American outdoor companies with similar humble origins, and with a shared goal to better serve those who love the outdoors, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Bass Pro Shops will acquire Cabela’s for $65.50 per share in cash, representing an aggregate transaction value of approximately $5.5 billion.

In addition, upon closing Bass Pro Shops will commence a multi-year partnership agreement with Capital One, National Association, a wholly-owned national banking subsidiary of Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE: COF), under which Capital One will originate and service the Cabela’s CLUB, Cabela’s co-branded credit card, and Bass Pro Shops will maintain a seamless integration between the credit card program and the combined companies’ retail operations and deep customer relationships. All Cabela’s CLUB points and Bass Pro Shops Outdoor Rewards points will be unaffected by the transactions and customers can continue to use their credit cards as they were prior to the transaction. Capital One intends to continue to operate the Cabela’s CLUB servicing center in Lincoln, Nebraska.

A driving force behind this agreement is the highly complementary business philosophies, product offerings, expertise and geographic footprints of the two businesses. The essence of both Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s is a deep passion to serve outdoor enthusiasts and support conservation. The combination brings together three of the nation's premier sporting brands: Cabela’s, a leader in hunting; Bass Pro Shops, a leader in fishing; and White River Marine Group, a worldwide leader in boating, which is part of Bass Pro Shops.

Bass Pro Shops, Cabela’s and White River Marine Group represent the best of American entrepreneurship, innovation and devotion to customers. The combined companies will strive to provide a remarkably enhanced experience for customers, increased opportunities for team members and greater support for conservation activities.

All Cabela’s CLUB points and Bass Pro Shops Outdoor Rewards points will be unaffected by the transactions and customers can continue to use their credit cards as they were prior to the transaction. Capital One intends to continue to operate the Cabela’s CLUB servicing center in Lincoln, Nebraska.  A driving force behind this agreement is the highly complementary business philosophies, product offerings, expertise and geographic footprints of the two businesses. The essence of both Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s is a deep passion to serve outdoor enthusiasts and support conservation. The combination brings together three of the nation's premier sporting brands: Cabela’s, a leader in hunting; Bass Pro Shops, a leader in fishing; and White River Marine Group, a worldwide leader in boating, which is part of Bass Pro Shops.  Bass Pro Shops, Cabela’s and White River Marine Group represent the best of American entrepreneurship, innovation and devotion to customers. The combined companies will strive to provide a remarkably enhanced experience for customers, increased opportunities for team members and greater support for conservation activities.  CABELA’S  Founded in 1961 by Dick, Mary and Jim Cabela, Cabela’s is a highly respected marketer of hunting, fishing, camping, shooting sports and related outdoor merchandise. Today, Cabela’s has over 19,000 “outfitters” operating 85 specialty retail stores, primarily in the western U.S. and Canada. Cabela’s stores, catalog business and e-commerce operations will blend seamlessly with Bass Pro Shops and White River Marine Group. Over the past 55 years Cabela’s has built a passionate and loyal base of millions of enthusiasts who shop both at its retail stores and online.  BASS PRO SHOPS  Bass Pro Shops, founded in 1972 by avid young angler Johnny Morris, is a leading national retailer of outdoor gear and apparel, with 99 stores and Tracker Marine Centers located primarily in the eastern part of the U.S. and Canada. Morris started the business with eight square feet of space in the back of his father's liquor store in Springfield, Mo., the company’s sole location for the first 13 years of business. Johnny’s passion for the outdoors and his feel for the products and shopping experiences desired by outdoor enthusiasts helped transform the industry. Bass Pro Shops, which employs approximately 20,000 team members, has been named by Forbes as one of ""America's Best Employers."" The company also operates Big Cedar Lodge, America’s Premier Wilderness Resort, welcoming more than one million guests annually to Missouri’s Ozark Mountains.  WHITE RIVER MARINE GROUP  In 1978, Morris revolutionized the marine industry when he introduced the world's first professionally rigged and nationally marketed boat, motor and trailer packages. Tracker quickly became and has remained the number one selling fishing boat brand in America for the last 37 years running. White River Marine Group offers an unsurpassed collection of industry-leading brands including Tracker Boats, Sun Tracker, Nitro, Tahoe, Regency, Mako, Ranger, Triton and Stratos.  MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY  ""Today's announcement marks an exceptional opportunity to bring together three special companies with an abiding love for the outdoors and a passion for serving sportsmen and sportswomen,"" said Johnny Morris, founder and CEO of Bass Pro Shops. ""The story of each of these companies could only have happened in America, made possible by our uniquely American free enterprise system. We have enormous admiration for Cabela’s, its founders and outfitters, and its loyal base of customers. We look forward to continuing to celebrate and grow the Cabela’s brand alongside Bass Pro Shops and White River as one unified outdoor family.”  ""Cabela’s is pleased to have found the ideal partner in Bass Pro Shops,"" said Tommy Millner, Cabela’s Chief Executive Officer. ""Having undertaken a thorough strategic review, during which we assessed a wide variety of options to maximize value, the Board unanimously concluded that this combination with Bass Pro Shops is the best path forward for Cabela’s, its shareholders, outfitters and customers. In addition to providing significant immediate value to our shareholders, this partnership provides a unique platform from which our brand will be extremely well positioned to continue to serve outdoor enthusiasts worldwide for generations to come.""  ""This opportunity would not be possible without the contributions of the many wonderful Cabela’s, Bass Pro Shops and White River team members,” Morris said. “All three companies are blessed to have been built by the extraordinary efforts of many tremendously talented, dedicated people throughout our respective histories, and we're thrilled to consider what the combined team can achieve going forward.”  Following the closing of the transaction, Bass Pro Shops intends to celebrate and grow the Cabela’s brand and will build on qualities that respective customers love most about Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops. In addition, Bass Pro Shops recognizes the strength of Cabela’s CLUB Loyalty program and intends to honor Cabela’s customer rewards and sees potential over time to expand the program in the combined company.  Bass Pro Shops appreciates and understands the deep ties between Cabela’s and the community of Sidney, Nebraska. Dick, Mary and Jim Cabela founded their company in Sidney in 1961, and the company has flourished with its base of operations there ever since. Bass Pro Shops intends to continue to maintain important bases of operations in Sidney and Lincoln and hopes to continue the very favorable connections to those communities and the Cabela’s team members residing there.  Bass Pro Shops Founder and CEO Johnny Morris will continue as CEO and majority shareholder of the new entity, which will remain a private company with a continuing long-term view of supporting the industry and conservation. Morris earned a reputation as a leading retailer and conservationist. In 2008, the National Retail Federation named him as Retail Innovator of the Year. In 2015, the same organization named him as one of 25 People Shaping the Future of Retail in America. In 2012, The Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies named Morris Citizen Conservationist of the Year.  “Conservation is at the heart and soul of Bass Pro Shops. Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s share a steadfast belief that the future of our industry, and the outdoor sports we all love, depends - more than anything else - on how we manage our natural resources,” said Morris. “By combining our efforts, we can have a profound positive impact on the conservation challenges of our day and help foster the next generation of outdoor enthusiasts.”  PREFERRED FINANCING  Bass Pro Shops is proud to have secured preferred equity financing from the Merchant Banking Division of Goldman Sachs and Pamplona to facilitate the transaction. Goldman Sachs has committed $1.8 billion and Pamplona has committed $600 million for a total preferred financing commitment of $2.4 billion.  The Merchant Banking Division of Goldman Sachs is one of the leading private equity investors in the world, focusing on assisting large, high-quality companies with best-in-class management teams to achieve their growth objectives.

Under the terms of the agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, at the closing of the transaction Baker Hughes shareholders will receive a special one-time cash dividend of $17.50 per share and 37.5% of the new company. GE will own 62.5% of the company. The transaction is expected to close in mid 2017. 

“This transaction creates an industry leader, one that is ideally positioned to grow in any market. Oil & gas customers demand more productive solutions. This can only be achieved through technical innovation and service execution, the hallmarks of GE and Baker Hughes,” said Jeff Immelt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GE. “As we built the GE Oil & Gas business, I have always been impressed by the respect our customers have for Baker Hughes. GE Oil & Gas is a key GE business, one that fully leverages the GE Store. As we go forward, this transaction accelerates our capability to extend the digital framework to the oil and gas industry. An oilfield service platform is essential to deliver digitally enabled offerings to our customers. We expect Predix to become an industry standard and synonymous with improved customer outcomes. GE investors will benefit through ownership of a stronger business with substantial synergies and an improved competitive position. The transaction is expected to add approximately $.04 to GE EPS in 2018, $.08 by 2020.” 

Martin Craighead, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Baker Hughes said, “This compelling combination brings together best-in-class oilfield equipment manufacturing and services, and digital technology offerings for the benefit of all customers and stakeholders. The combination of our complementary assets will create a platform capable of seamless integration while we enhance our ability to deliver optimized and integrated solutions and increase touch points with our customers. In addition, Baker Hughes shareholders will receive a special one-time cash dividend of $17.50 per share and benefit from the upside of a stronger, larger business. With employees of Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas coming together, the new company will be an industry leader, well-positioned to compete in the oil and gas industry while pushing the boundaries of innovation for our customers.” 

Lorenzo Simonelli, who is currently president and CEO of GE Oil & Gas said, “This transformative transaction will create a powerful force in the oil and gas market as we continue to drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders. This transaction is also exciting for employees of both companies. GE Oil & Gas and Baker Hughes are an exceptional cultural fit, sharing a commitment to exceeding customer expectations. Both companies’ employees will benefit significantly from being part of a larger, stronger company that is positioned for long-term growth. We look forward to combining the digital solutions and technology from the GE Store with the domain expertise of Baker Hughes and its culture of innovation in the oilfield services sector.” 

Compelling Strategic and Financial Benefits of the Transaction 

Complementary assets and integrated offerings will provide differentiated services for combined company’s customers. The company will combine the digital solutions, manufacturing expertise and technology from the GE Store and the outstanding track record of success Baker Hughes has in the oilfield services sector. With combined revenue of over $32 billion1 the product portfolio of GE Oil & Gas and Baker Hughes in drilling, completions, production and midstream / downstream equipment and services will create the second largest player in the oilfield equipment and services industry. Customers should expect sustainable innovation and integration that will deliver valuable outcomes. As one company, we will have operations in more than 120 countries. Both companies have invested even in the downturn and have strong, complementary competitive scope across the industry. From GE’s fullstream oil and gas manufacturing and technology solutions spanning across subsea & drilling, rotating equipment, imaging and sensing to the Baker Hughes portfolio in Drilling & Evaluation and Completion & Production, the combined company will be moving beyond oilfield services and into oil and gas productivity solutions. 
The combination produces substantial synergies through combined efficiency and growth. The companies expect to generate total runrate synergies of $1.6 billion by 2020, which has a net present value of $14 billion. While this is primarily driven by cost out, we believe that the new company is positioned for growth as the industry rebounds. 
Combination positioned to create value for Baker Hughes shareholders. The diversified portfolio can deliver through the oil and gas cycle. There is a large pool of synergies that will improve operating margins and drive organic growth. The “New” Baker Hughes has a strong balance sheet. 
Combination positioned to create value for GE shareholders. The transaction is expected to be accretive to GE’s earnings per share by $.04 by 2018 and $.08 by 2020. This is another step in creating the premium digital industrial company. 
The “New” Baker Hughes is expected to be the partner and employer of choice for the industry. Combination is an exceptional cultural fit. Both companies’ employees will benefit significantly from being part of a larger, more diversified company.

GE will own 62.5% of the company. The transaction is expected to close in mid 2017.   “This transaction creates an industry leader, one that is ideally positioned to grow in any market. Oil & gas customers demand more productive solutions. This can only be achieved through technical innovation and service execution, the hallmarks of GE and Baker Hughes,” said Jeff Immelt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GE. “As we built the GE Oil & Gas business, I have always been impressed by the respect our customers have for Baker Hughes. GE Oil & Gas is a key GE business, one that fully leverages the GE Store. As we go forward, this transaction accelerates our capability to extend the digital framework to the oil and gas industry. An oilfield service platform is essential to deliver digitally enabled offerings to our customers. We expect Predix to become an industry standard and synonymous with improved customer outcomes.

TransDigm and Breeze-Eastern both design, manufacture and supply highly engineered aircraft components.

Under the terms of the agreement, a subsidiary of TransDigm will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Breeze-Eastern common stock for $19.61 per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $206 million. Following the purchase of shares through the tender offer, TransDigm will complete the transaction by acquiring all remaining shares not acquired in the offer through a merger at the same price as the tender offer.  The transaction will be funded with TransDigm's cash on hand and is not subject to any financing condition. The merger agreement was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of Breeze-Eastern.

W. Nicholas Howley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TransDigm, stated, ""Breeze-Eastern pioneered the technology for helicopter rescue hoists and cargo winches and subsequently became a leading global designer and manufacturer of highly engineered, proprietary rescue hoists, winches and cargo hooks, as well as weapons-handling systems equipment, which currently can be found on all types of military and civilian aircraft.  Major customers include Sikorsky, Boeing, AgustaWestland, Airbus and the U.S. Government, serving such platforms as the UH-60 Blackhawk, CH-47 Chinook, Airbus A400M transport, HH-65 Dolphin and AW-139 series helicopter. About 75% of Breeze-Eastern's total revenue is derived from military markets and 70% from aftermarket products, with the vast majority being from proprietary products. We are pleased to have an agreement to acquire Breeze-Eastern given that the proprietary nature of these products, along with significant aftermarket content, fits well with our overall business strategy.""

Brad Pedersen, Breeze-Eastern's President and CEO, added, ""We believe Breeze-Eastern will be an excellent addition to the TransDigm portfolio of companies, as our products, business model, strategy and focus are closely aligned.  Being part of a larger aerospace company will allow for further growth opportunities and provide resources for Breeze-Eastern to continue developing the highly engineered life-saving products that we're known for today.  On account of this, we believe the transaction positions Breeze-Eastern well for the future and is good news for Breeze-Eastern's stockholders, employees, customers and suppliers.   We are proud of our history and accomplishments and look forward to our future together with TransDigm.""

TransDigm and Breeze-Eastern both design, manufacture and supply highly engineered aircraft components.  Under the terms of the agreement, a subsidiary of TransDigm will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Breeze-Eastern common stock for $19.61 per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $206 million.

Transaction Expected to be Immediately Accretive to SXL Distributable Cash Flow 

Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. (NYSE: SXL) and Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (NYSE: ETP) today announced that they have entered into a merger agreement providing for the acquisition of ETP by SXL in a unit-for-unit transaction. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors and conflicts committees of both partnerships and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to receipt of ETP unitholder approval and other customary closing conditions. 

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161121005638/en/ 

Under the terms of the transaction, ETP unitholders will receive 1.5 common units of SXL for each common unit of ETP they own. This equates to a 10% premium to the volume weighted average pricing of ETP’s common units for the last 30 trading days immediately prior to the announcement of the transaction. 

As SXL will be the acquiring entity, the existing incentive distribution rights provisions in the SXL partnership agreement will continue to be in effect, and Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (NYSE: ETE) will own the incentive distribution rights of SXL following the closing of the transaction. As part of this transaction, ETE has agreed to continue to provide all the incentive distribution right subsidies that are currently in effect with respect to both partnerships. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to SXL’s distributable cash flow per common unit and is also expected to allow the combined partnership to be in position to achieve near-term distribution increases in the low double digits and a more than 1.0x distribution coverage ratio. 

The transaction is expected to provide significant benefits for SXL and ETP unitholders as the combined partnership will have increased scale and diversification across multiple producing basins and will have greater opportunities to more closely integrate SXL’s natural gas liquids business with ETP’s natural gas gathering, processing and transportation business. With this transaction, SXL and ETP expect to build upon their experience working together as partners in several joint ventures to pursue commercial opportunities and to achieve cost savings while enhancing the service capabilities for their customers. SXL and ETP expect that the transaction will allow for commercial synergies and costs savings in excess of $200 million annually by 2019. 

The transaction is also expected to strengthen the balance sheet of the combined organization by utilizing cash distribution savings to reduce debt and to fund a portion of the growth capital expenditure programs of the two partnerships. ETP and SXL have spent approximately $15 billion in organic growth capital over the past several years, and these expenditures, combined with the completion of other major capital projects currently in progress, are expected to continue to generate strong distributable cash flow growth. 

Both ETP and SXL management teams are pleased to be able to bring two strong partnerships together in this strategic transaction that combines the premier crude oil midstream MLP with the premier natural gas midstream MLP. The combined partnership is expected to be the second largest MLP as measured by enterprise value. 

At the closing of the transaction, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer of the combined partnership will be Kelcy Warren, Mackie McCrea, Matt Ramsey and Tom Long, respectively, and it is expected that Mike Hennigan and other members of the SXL management team will continue in leading management roles of the combined company with the SXL business headquartered in Philadelphia. 

SXL and ETP will hold a joint conference call to discuss the transaction details on Monday, November 21, 2016 at 3:00 p.m. Central Time (4:00 p.m. Eastern Time). An investor presentation will be posted to the partnerships’ websites and filed with the SEC on a Form 8-K.

Great Plains Energy Incorporated (NYSE: GXP), the parent company of KCP&L, and Westar Energy, Inc. (NYSE: WR), today announced a definitive agreement for Great Plains Energy to acquire Westar in a combined cash and stock transaction with an enterprise value of approximately $12.2 billion, including total equity value of approximately $8.6 billion. Upon closing, Westar will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy.

Once the transaction is complete, Great Plains Energy will have more than 1.5 million customers in Kansas and Missouri, nearly 13,000 megawatts of generation capacity, almost 10,000 miles of transmission lines and over 51,000 miles of distribution lines. In addition, more than 45 percent of the combined utility’s retail customer demand can be met with emission-free energy.

“Westar and KCP&L are trusted neighbors and have worked together for generations in Kansas. The combination of our two companies is the best fit for meeting our region’s energy needs,” said Terry Bassham, chairman and chief executive officer of Great Plains Energy and KCP&L. “This is an important transaction for Kansas and our entire region. By combining our two companies, we are keeping ownership local and management responsive to regulators, customers and regional needs, while enhancing our ability to build long-term value for shareholders.”

Currently, Great Plains Energy and Westar jointly own and operate the Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station, as well as the La Cygne and Jeffrey power plants. With the addition of Westar’s generation fleet, Great Plains Energy will have a more diverse and sustainable generation portfolio. This will provide increased flexibility to mitigate the potential customer impacts from future carbon regulation. In addition, among investor-owned utilities in the United States, the combined company will have one of the largest portfolios of wind generation in the country.

“This is an important day for Westar, our customers, employees, shareholders, the communities we support and for the state of Kansas,” said Mark Ruelle, president and chief executive officer of Westar. “Our commitment to reliability, customer satisfaction, safety and sustainability is consistent with Great Plains Energy’s values, which makes them our ideal partner. We’re eager to join the Great Plains Energy team, and excited about this new chapter that combines the unique strengths of our respective organizations to form an even stronger company for our state.”

Great Plains Energy has an established track record of successful integration with adjacent electric utilities. In 2008, Great Plains Energy completed its acquisition of Aquila, an electric utility serving customers in adjacent areas of Missouri. That successful acquisition has delivered – and continues to deliver – significant savings for customers, which exceeded initial expectations and was reviewed and approved by both the Missouri Public Service Commission and the Kansas Corporation Commission.

“The utility industry is facing rising customer expectations, increasing environmental standards and emerging cyber security threats. These factors, coupled with slower demand growth for electricity, are driving our costs and customer rates higher. Our acquisition of Westar will create operational efficiencies and future cost savings that will benefit all involved – customers, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve. These savings also will help reduce future rate increase requests,” said Bassham. “Combining our two companies will result in cost savings and operational benefits for our more than 900,000 Kansas and 600,000 Missouri customers.”

Transaction terms and financing profile

Under the terms of the agreement, which was unanimously approved by the boards of directors for both companies, Westar shareholders will receive $60.00 per share of total consideration for each share of Westar common stock, consisting of $51.00 in cash and $9.00 in Great Plains Energy common stock, subject to a 7.5 percent collar based upon the Great Plains Energy common stock price at the time of the closing of the transaction, with the exchange ratio for the stock consideration ranging between 0.2709 to 0.3148 shares of Great Plains Energy common stock for each Westar share of common stock, representing a consideration mix of 85 percent cash and 15 percent stock.

The transaction enterprise value is expected to be approximately $12.2 billion, inclusive of approximately $8.6 billion in total stock and cash consideration to be received by Westar’s shareholders and the assumption of approximately $3.6 billion in Westar’s debt. Great Plains Energy has secured approximately $8.0 billion of committed debt financing from Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC in connection with the transaction for the full cash portion of the transaction consideration. Great Plains Energy has also secured a $750 million mandatorily preferred convertible equity commitment from the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), to be funded at the closing of the transaction. Great Plains Energy plans to issue long-term financing consisting of a combination of equity, equity-linked securities and debt prior to closing of the transaction. This financing mix will allow Great Plains Energy to maintain its solid, investment grade credit ratings.

Great Plains Energy expects savings generated from combining the two companies to be consistent with recent comparable transactions, and its own recent experience. Great Plains Energy expects the acquisition will be neutral to earnings-per-share in the first full calendar year of operations and significantly accretive thereafter. The long-term earnings growth target of the combined company is expected to grow to six to eight percent—better than either company on a standalone basis.

Leadership and headquarters

Upon completion of the transaction, Bassham will be chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company. Ruelle will remain in his current role with Westar until the closing of the transaction. In addition, Great Plains Energy will add one director from the Westar Board of Directors to the Great Plains Energy Board of Directors.

“We understand the importance of Westar to the communities it serves and the meaningful contributions it makes as a major employer in Kansas,” said Bassham. “We are committed to maintaining the operating headquarters for our Kansas service territory in downtown Topeka. We also know that Westar has a reputation as a strong supporter of community and charitable initiatives. We will continue this legacy and are committed to maintaining a strong presence in all of the communities Westar serves.”

Sustainability

Customers today expect their utility providers to identify and advance energy efficiency options that give them greater control and choice. The combined company will have a greater, more diverse portfolio of energy solutions that give customers the opportunities to better manage their individual energy needs. In addition, Great Plains Energy operates the nation’s largest utility-owned electric vehicle charging network, which can be expanded to benefit Westar’s customers.

Regulatory Approval

The companies anticipate making the required regulatory filings with the Kansas Corporation Commission and other regulatory entities during June and July of 2016. In addition, Great Plains Energy and Westar will seek shareholder approvals later this year. The transaction is subject to approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The transaction also is subject to the notification, clearance and reporting requirements under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act by the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice. The companies anticipate closing in the spring of 2017. In the coming months, the companies will work together to develop a robust integration plan.

(NYSE: WR), today announced a definitive agreement for Great Plains Energy to acquire Westar in a combined cash and stock transaction with an enterprise value of approximately $12.2 billion, including total equity value of approximately $8.6 billion. Upon closing, Westar will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy.  Once the transaction is complete, Great Plains Energy will have more than 1.5 million customers in Kansas and Missouri, nearly 13,000 megawatts of generation capacity, almost 10,000 miles of transmission lines and over 51,000 miles of distribution lines. In addition, more than 45 percent of the combined utility’s retail customer demand can be met with emission-free energy.  “Westar and KCP&L are trusted neighbors and have worked together for generations in Kansas. The combination of our two companies is the best fit for meeting our region’s energy needs,” said Terry Bassham, chairman and chief executive officer of Great Plains Energy and KCP&L. “This is an important transaction for Kansas and our entire region. By combining our two companies, we are keeping ownership local and management responsive to regulators, customers and regional needs, while enhancing our ability to build long-term value for shareholders.”  Currently, Great Plains Energy and Westar jointly own and operate the Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station, as well as the La Cygne and Jeffrey power plants. With the addition of Westar’s generation fleet, Great Plains Energy will have a more diverse and sustainable generation portfolio. This will provide increased flexibility to mitigate the potential customer impacts from future carbon regulation. In addition, among investor-owned utilities in the United States, the combined company will have one of the largest portfolios of wind generation in the country.  “This is an important day for Westar, our customers, employees, shareholders, the communities we support and for the state of Kansas,” said Mark Ruelle, president and chief executive officer of Westar. “Our commitment to reliability, customer satisfaction, safety and sustainability is consistent with Great Plains Energy’s values, which makes them our ideal partner. We’re eager to join the Great Plains Energy team, and excited about this new chapter that combines the unique strengths of our respective organizations to form an even stronger company for our state.”  Great Plains Energy has an established track record of successful integration with adjacent electric utilities. In 2008, Great Plains Energy completed its acquisition of Aquila, an electric utility serving customers in adjacent areas of Missouri. That successful acquisition has delivered – and continues to deliver – significant savings for customers, which exceeded initial expectations and was reviewed and approved by both the Missouri Public Service Commission and the Kansas Corporation Commission.  “The utility industry is facing rising customer expectations, increasing environmental standards and emerging cyber security threats. These factors, coupled with slower demand growth for electricity, are driving our costs and customer rates higher. Our acquisition of Westar will create operational efficiencies and future cost savings that will benefit all involved – customers, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve. These savings also will help reduce future rate increase requests,” said Bassham. “Combining our two companies will result in cost savings and operational benefits for our more than 900,000 Kansas and 600,000 Missouri customers.”  Transaction terms and financing profile  Under the terms of the agreement, which was unanimously approved by the boards of directors for both companies, Westar shareholders will receive $60.00 per share of total consideration for each share of Westar common stock, consisting of $51.00 in cash and $9.00 in Great Plains Energy common stock, subject to a 7.5 percent collar based upon the Great Plains Energy common stock price at the time of the closing of the transaction, with the exchange ratio for the stock consideration ranging between 0.2709 to 0.3148 shares of Great Plains Energy common stock for each Westar share of common stock, representing a consideration mix of 85 percent cash and 15 percent stock.  The transaction enterprise value is expected to be approximately $12.2 billion, inclusive of approximately $8.6 billion in total stock and cash consideration to be received by Westar’s shareholders and the assumption of approximately $3.6 billion in Westar’s debt. Great Plains Energy has secured approximately $8.0 billion of committed debt financing from Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC in connection with the transaction for the full cash portion of the transaction consideration. Great Plains Energy has also secured a $750 million mandatorily preferred convertible equity commitment from the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), to be funded at the closing of the transaction. Great Plains Energy plans to issue long-term financing consisting of a combination of equity, equity-linked securities and debt prior to closing of the transaction. This financing mix will allow Great Plains Energy to maintain its solid, investment grade credit ratings.  Great Plains Energy expects savings generated from combining the two companies to be consistent with recent comparable transactions, and its own recent experience. Great Plains Energy expects the acquisition will be neutral to earnings-per-share in the first full calendar year of operations and significantly accretive thereafter. The long-term earnings growth target of the combined company is expected to grow to six to eight percent—better than either company on a standalone basis.  Leadership and headquarters  Upon completion of the transaction, Bassham will be chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company. Ruelle will remain in his current role with Westar until the closing of the transaction. In addition, Great Plains Energy will add one director from the Westar Board of Directors to the Great Plains Energy Board of Directors.  “We understand the importance of Westar to the communities it serves and the meaningful contributions it makes as a major employer in Kansas,” said Bassham. “We are committed to maintaining the operating headquarters for our Kansas service territory in downtown Topeka. We also know that Westar has a reputation as a strong supporter of community and charitable initiatives. We will continue this legacy and are committed to maintaining a strong presence in all of the communities Westar serves.”  Sustainability  Customers today expect their utility providers to identify and advance energy efficiency options that give them greater control and choice. The combined company will have a greater, more diverse portfolio of energy solutions that give customers the opportunities to better manage their individual energy needs. In addition, Great Plains Energy operates the nation’s largest utility-owned electric vehicle charging network, which can be expanded to benefit Westar’s customers.  Regulatory Approval  The companies anticipate making the required regulatory filings with the Kansas Corporation Commission and other regulatory entities during June and July of 2016. In addition, Great Plains Energy and Westar will seek shareholder approvals later this year. The transaction is subject to approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The transaction also is subject to the notification, clearance and reporting requirements under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act by the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice. The companies anticipate closing in the spring of 2017. In the coming months, the companies will work together to develop a robust integration plan.  Advisors  Goldman, Sachs & Co. served as the exclusive financial advisor and Bracewell LLP served as legal advisor to Great Plains Energy. Guggenheim Securities, LLC served as the sole financial advisor and Baker Botts LLP served as legal advisor to Westar Energy.  Analyst Conference Call/Webcast  Great Plains Energy and Westar will host a financial community conference call to provide additional information on Tuesday, May 31, 2016, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time/9:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time to discuss the Great Plains Energy and Westar transaction.  A live audio webcast of the conference call and presentation slides will be available on the investor relations page of Great Plains Energy’s website at www.greatplainsenergy.com.

  Acquisition Represents Premium of 56% Over Closing Stock Price
  CHICAGO, NEW YORK and BOCA RATON, Fla., Feb. 16, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --
The ADT Corporation (NYSE:ADT) (""ADT""), a leading provider of monitored
security, interactive home and business automation and related monitoring
services in the United States and Canada, today announced that it has
entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an affiliate of
certain funds (the ""Apollo Funds"") managed by affiliates of Apollo Global
Management, LLC (NYSE:APO) (together with its consolidated subsidiaries,
""Apollo"") and co-investors and merged with a subsidiary of Prime Security
Services Borrower, LLC (with its subsidiaries, ""Protection 1""), a leading
full-service business and home security company in the United States also
owned by the Apollo Funds, for $42.00 per share in cash. The purchase price
represents a premium of approximately 56% over ADT's closing share price on
February 12, 2016 and, when combined with Protection 1, represents an
aggregate transaction value of approximately $15 billion. The headquarters
of the combined company will remain in Boca Raton, FL, and the combined
company will operate primarily under the ADT brand.
  ""This transaction represents a highly attractive premium for ADT's
shareholders,"" said Naren Gursahaney, President and CEO of ADT.  ""We're
proud to have strengthened the quality of our customer base, improved
service and retention, and extended our leadership in innovative solutions
such as our ADT Pulse platform and our new Security-as-a-Service offering,
ADT Canopy. By combining Protection 1 with ADT, we will be better positioned
to expand the breadth and depth of the services we offer to our customers
throughout the United States and Canada.""
  ""The combined company will be a market leader with a powerful brand and
scale resulting in an enhanced overall customer experience,"" said Timothy J.
Whall, President and CEO of Protection 1, who will be the CEO of the
combined business following the closing of the transaction.  ""In addition,
Protection 1's robust commercial presence will speed ADT's expansion into
the commercial sector supported by increasing commercial sales and technical
skills across a well matched national footprint.""
  ""We are tremendously excited by this unique opportunity to combine two
premier businesses,"" said Marc Becker, Senior Partner at Apollo. ""This
transaction provides the opportunity to dramatically enhance our position in
the large, fragmented and growing residential and business interactive
electronic monitoring industry.  Pro forma for the transaction, the newly
created company will generate a combined $318 million in recurring monthly
revenue and total annual revenue in excess of $4.2 billion, placing the
businesses in a strong position to drive innovation and to capitalize on
growth opportunities in the future.""
  The Board of Directors of ADT unanimously approved the transaction. The
acquisition of ADT is expected to be completed by June 2016. The transaction
is subject to the conclusion of the applicable antitrust waiting periods in
the United States and Canada, ADT stockholder approval and other customary
closing conditions.
  The merger agreement includes a ""go-shop"" period, during which ADT and its
Board of Directors may actively solicit, receive, evaluate and potentially
enter into negotiations with parties that offer alternative proposals during
a 40-day period following the execution date of the definitive agreement.
There can be no assurance that this process will result in a superior
proposal. ADT does not intend to disclose developments about this process
unless and until its Board has made a decision with respect to any potential
superior proposal.
  The transaction, which has fully committed financing in place, will be
financed primarily through the incurrence of $1.555 billion in new first
lien term loans, $3.140 billion in new second lien financing, the issuance
of $750 million of preferred securities to an affiliate of Koch Equity
Development LLC, the investment and acquisition subsidiary of Koch
Industries, Inc., and an equity contribution of approximately $4.5 billion
from funds managed by Apollo and co-investors.  Protection 1 will also enter
into a new $255 million first lien revolving facility concurrently with the
closing of the merger, bringing the total combined senior secured revolving
facility to $350 million.  Protection 1 further expects that its existing
$1,095 million first lien term loan and $260 million second lien term loan
will remain outstanding. In addition, concurrently with the closing of the
merger, Protection 1 intends to redeem all of ADT's outstanding senior
unsecured 2.250% notes due July 2017 and senior unsecured 4.125% notes due
April 2019, which will be redeemed in accordance with the applicable
indenture, and to repay all outstanding borrowings under ADT's revolving
credit facility.  Finally, ADT's remaining $3.750 billion of total senior
unsecured notes will be guaranteed by Protection 1 and all wholly owned
domestic subsidiaries of the combined company and will be secured by first
priority security interests in substantially all of the assets of the issuer
and the guarantors.  As a result, Protection 1 expects that these notes will
maintain their current ratings and remain outstanding.

Greater Potential to Enhance Shareholder Returns Through Overlay of Investment Management Economics across a Larger Balance Sheet 

NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE: NSAM), Colony Capital, Inc. (“Colony”) (NYSE: CLNY) and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. (NYSE: NRF) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create a world-class, internally-managed, diversified real estate and investment management platform. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Special Committees of NSAM and NRF, and the Board of Directors of Colony. The combined company will be named “Colony NorthStar, Inc.” 

Upon completion of the transaction, terms of which are detailed below, NSAM shareholders will own approximately 32.85%, Colony shareholders will own approximately 33.25% and NRF shareholders will own approximately 33.90% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. NSAM shareholders will also receive, in addition to its regular quarterly dividend, a special cash dividend equal to $128 million, which represents a one-time distribution of excess NSAM taxable earnings and profits. 

Upon closing of the transaction, Thomas J. Barrack Jr. will be Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Colony NorthStar, David Hamamoto will be Executive Vice Chairman, and Richard B. Saltzman will be Chief Executive Officer. 

David Hamamoto, Executive Chairman of NSAM and Chairman of NRF, stated, “We are incredibly excited to merge with Colony to create a global real estate leader well positioned for long-term growth. This strategic combination is the next logical step for NSAM and NRF, creating substantial value for shareholders and transforming the companies into a world-class, internally-managed equity REIT that includes a sizable, established institutional and retail asset management platform. We are confident that Colony NorthStar with its lower leverage, larger balance sheet and improved liquidity profile is poised for meaningful multiple expansion and substantially enhanced long-term returns for shareholders.” 

Thomas J. Barrack, Jr., Executive Chairman of Colony, stated, “This is an amazing combination of three highly compatible companies with complementary strategic priorities that we expect will deliver substantial value for all three sets of shareholders. The combined company will have both the capability and balance sheet capacity to deploy capital to establish and fortify foundational equity real estate positions through all points in the cycle, across geographies, asset types and capital structures. We also will realize substantial efficiencies and synergies by bringing our organizations together and offering a well curated menu of durable real estate business lines with broad-based capital access.” 

“The pro forma combined enterprise’s enhanced scale, diversification, and unique platforms will foster the ability to generate substantial return on equity through high quality real estate investments enhanced by attractive investment management revenues,” said Richard B. Saltzman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Colony. “In addition, the merger produces an outstanding partnership of complementary management talent with access to enormous capital and distribution resources for the benefit of our shareholders.” 

Transaction Delivers a Number of Strategic and Financial Benefits 

Creates World-Class Real Estate and Investment Management Platform: Global, diversified equity REIT with $58 billion of assets under management, led by a seasoned management team with access to proprietary deal sourcing and a significant track record as a global investor, operator and asset manager. 
Larger, More Diversified and Stable Investment Portfolio: Well-diversified portfolio of investments with concentration in scaled verticals across geographies, property types and capital stack positions, consisting primarily of owned real estate. 
Significant Cost Savings: Approximately $115 million in total annual cost synergies, consisting of approximately $80 million of cash savings and approximately $35 million of stock based compensation savings, expected to be realized post-closing. 
Stronger Balance Sheet, Ongoing Deleveraging and Improved Liquidity: Asset monetization and sale initiatives by NRF, totaling approximately $1.5 billion in projected net proceeds, are expected to bring the total debt-to-capitalization ratio of the combined company under 50%, while continuing with an objective of upgrading the credit profile of the combined company and lowering the overall cost of capital. 
Increased Scale and Value Creation: Colony NorthStar is expected to be in the top quartile ranked by equity market capitalization, according to the MSCI U.S. REIT Index (RMZ) classification, with a broad platform that expands its ability to deploy third-party fee-bearing capital to accelerate growth and provide enhanced returns to shareholders from consistent, longer duration fee related income. 
Widens Access to Multiple Sources of Capital: Unmatched access to global investors targeting real estate investment through public vehicles, private institutional and retail capital platforms. 
Transaction Structure 

Under the terms of the merger agreement, NSAM will redomesticate to Maryland and elect to be treated as an REIT beginning in 2017, and NRF and Colony, through a series of transactions, will merge with and into the redomesticated NSAM, which will be renamed Colony NorthStar, Inc. NSAM shareholders will continue to own one (1) share of Colony NorthStar common stock for each share of NSAM common stock they previously owned. Colony common shareholders will receive 1.4663 shares of Colony NorthStar’s common stock for each share of Colony common stock they own, and NRF common shareholders will receive 1.0996 shares of Colony NorthStar’s common stock for each share of NRF common stock they own. Each of Colony and NRF has preferred stock outstanding and the holders of such preferred stock will receive shares of preferred stock of Colony NorthStar that are substantially similar to the preferred stock held prior to the closing of the transaction. 

Certain NSAM and NRF executives have entered into agreements to vote their shares in favor of the transaction, and certain Colony executives, who collectively own approximately 16% of Colony’s outstanding common stock, have entered into agreements to vote their shares in favor of the transaction. 

Management and Governance 

Colony NorthStar’s board will consist of 13 directors in total – six nominated by NSAM and NRF, six nominated by Colony and one additional board member to be mutually agreed upon by the existing NSAM, Colony and NRF directors. The majority of the board will be comprised of independent directors. In addition to the roles outlined above for Messrs. Barrack, Hamamoto and Saltzman, Darren Tangen will be Chief Financial Officer and Mark Hedstrom will be Chief Operating Officer of the combined company. Al Tylis, NSAM’s Chief Executive Officer and a member of the NSAM and NRF Board of Directors, has agreed to assist in the transition following the merger. Dan Gilbert, NSAM and NRF's Chief Investment and Operating Officer will, among other responsibilities, continue to oversee Colony NorthStar’s retail platform. 

Messrs. Hamamoto, Tylis and Gilbert have agreed to reduce the cash severance payments and performance-based equity awards that would have been contractually owed to them upon consummation of the transaction by approximately (i) $52 million of cash payments and (ii) 2.6 million shares of performance-based equity awards which would have been earned based on current stock prices at the consummation of the transaction. Additionally, Messrs. Hamamoto, Tylis and Gilbert will forfeit performance-based awards with respect to approximately 1.2 million shares of NSAM common stock and 740,000 shares of NRF common stock as a result of the transaction. Furthermore, in lieu of any remaining cash severance payments resulting from the transaction that these executives would have been entitled to receive, Messrs. Hamamoto, Tylis and Gilbert will receive equity in Colony NorthStar, which will be subject to vesting based on continued employment with Colony NorthStar for one-year following the closing of the transaction, and with respect to Messrs. Hamamoto and Gilbert, will be subject to a two-year lock-up following the closing of the transaction. The number of such shares, in lieu of the remaining $106 million cash severance payments, will be determined based on the five day volume weighted average trading price of the shares of common stock of Colony NorthStar following the merger. Based on the June 2, 2016 closing price of NSAM, this would equate to approximately 8.6 million shares, or approximately 1.4%, of Colony NorthStar common stock, subject to the restrictions referred to above. Similarly, the number of remaining performance-based equity awards contractually owed to each of Messrs. Hamamoto, Tylis and Gilbert upon consummation of the transaction is approximately 2.5 million shares, or approximately 0.4%, of Colony NorthStar common stock. Additionally, Messrs. Hamamoto, Tylis and Gilbert have each agreed to a base salary of $1 for 2017 and have also agreed to forego a 2017 bonus. 

Approvals and Anticipated Closing 

The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and approval by the NSAM, Colony and NRF shareholders. 

Advisors 

NSAM is being advised by Goldman Sachs and is receiving legal counsel from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, compensation and benefits counsel from Goodwin Procter LLP and tax counsel from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Hunton & Williams LLP. NSAM’s Special Committee is being advised by Evercore and is receiving legal counsel from Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP and Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell LLP.

Company Updates Business Outlook for Fourth Quarter of 2016 

NeoPhotonics (NYSE: NPTN) (“NEOPHOTONICS” or the “Company”), a leading designer and manufacturer of advanced hybrid photonic integrated optoelectronic modules and subsystems for bandwidth-intensive, high-speed communications networks, today announced that it executed a definitive agreement, to sell its Access and Low Speed transceiver product lines (the “Low Speed Business”) to APAT Optoelectronics Components Co., Ltd. (“APAT OE”) of Shenzhen, China, a designer and manufacturer of optical sub-assemblies for telecom and datacom markets. 

The assets to be sold include the intellectual property, inventory and fixed assets for NeoPhotonics’ PON products including GPON and GEPON transceiver products at up to 10G data rates, plus 10G and below telecom, bidirectional and specialty transceiver products. 

The transaction is valued at approximately $26.4 million, inclusive of post-closing payments under a Transition Services Agreement. The transaction value consists of an equivalent of $25.0 million purchase price plus an additional equivalent of $1.4 million to be paid as certain transition services are delivered. The consideration consists of not less than the equivalent of $23.0 million to be paid in cash in China Renminbi at close and not more than $2.0 million in a US dollar denominated promissory note. In addition, the purchaser will assume outstanding supply chain purchase commitments and will be responsible for payment of value-added tax obligations. The purchase price is subject to adjustment after closing for inventory adjustments and by up to $10 million in the event of potential claims under transaction warranty commitments of NeoPhotonics. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in January 2017. The purchaser is further subject to a $1.0 million breakup fee to be held in escrow, which will be applied to the purchase price upon closing or forfeited if the transaction does not close due to certain reasons attributable to the purchaser. 

The secured promissory note of up to $2.0 million is for an initial term of six months with an initial interest rate of 6.0% per annum. The note is renewable at six month intervals with an increase in the interest rate by an additional 4% per annum. The note will be secured by inventory and certain fixed assets being purchased in the transaction. 

In 2015, and for the first 9 months of 2016, the Low Speed Business generated $92.8 million and $50.7 million in revenue, respectively, and gross profit of $16.7 million and $9.7 million, respectively. Net assets for the business were approximately $18.0 million as of September 30, 2016. 

Commenting on the transaction, Tim Jenks, NeoPhotonics Chief Executive Officer, stated, “After a comprehensive evaluation of the alternatives available for the Low Speed Business, we believe this transaction will best benefit our shareholders, customers, and employees. This transaction underscores our objective to focus our efforts on growing high speed optical networking products and solutions based on our advanced hybrid photonic integration technology platform to meet customer demand.” Jenks continued, “We believe the Low Speed Business will benefit from APAT OE's expertise in Access and PON products while continuing to provide quality products, support and services to customers.” 

“We are excited to have the NeoPhotonics low speed product team join APAT, and look forward to having more products to sell to our largest customers as well as the opportunity this transaction creates for us to gain many new customers,” commented Rex Gu, Founder and CEO of APAT OE. 

Raymond James & Associates, Inc. served as the exclusive financial advisor to NeoPhotonics for the transaction. Proskauer, Rose served as legal counsel to NeoPhotonics. 

Updated Outlook for the Fourth Quarter of 2016 

NeoPhotonics also announced an updated outlook for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2016, given recent developments. Demand in the fourth quarter continues to exceed the Company’s capacity to supply High Speed products while production capacities continue to increase. As new capacity has been brought on line, production yields at one of its fab facilities have been lower than anticipated, resulting in delayed shipments and higher manufacturing costs during the quarter versus previous projections. 

Taking this factor into account, the Company now expects its fourth quarter outlook to be as follows: 

         GAAP        Non-GAAP  
4Q’16 Revenue        $105 million to $109 million  
Gross Margin        27% to 30%        28% to 31%  
Operating Expenses        $30 to $32 million        $27 to $29 million  
Earnings per share        $(0.08) to $0.00        $0.03 to $0.11  

The Non-GAAP outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016 excludes the impact of expected amortization of intangibles of approximately $1.1 million and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation of approximately $4.4 million, of which $1.4 million is estimated for cost of goods sold, which are unchanged from previous projections. 

In the Company’s previously communicated outlook view, the Company anticipated that the Low Speed Business would produce revenues of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and range from $40 to $45 million in revenue in 2017. The comparable annual revenue for the Low Speed Business in 2016 is expected to be approximately $61 million. Upon divesting the Low Speed Business, the Company’s revenue growth rate for the continuing business is expected to be higher as a result. The Company’s business is seasonal on an annual cycle; the Company’s normalized first quarter revenue over the last several years has typically been 20 to 22% of the year in the first quarter, and then increasing throughout the remainder of the year. 

Non-GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA Measures vs. GAAP Financial Measures 

The Company’s non-GAAP measures exclude certain GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures differ from GAAP measures with the same captions and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies. As such, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze its operating performance and future prospects, develop internal budgets and financial goals, and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. NeoPhotonics believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of its operations that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business.

""This transaction with PLx Pharma reflects the continued commitment of Dipexium's Board of Directors and management team to deliver value to Dipexium stockholders,"" said David Luci, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dipexium.  ""The merger brings with it the PLx Pharma management team, comprised of highly accomplished and seasoned executives who have launched and successfully commercialized many market leading over-the-counter products, among them Mike Valentino as Executive Chairman of PLx Pharma, who previously launched multiple major Rx-to-OTC switches including Benadryl, Motrin Jr., Rogaine Extra Strength, Lamisil, Nasalcrom, Voltaren,  and most recently, as CEO of Adams Respiratory Therapeutics, Inc., Mucinex®.""

Earthbound Farm(R) and International Delight(R). Since becoming a public
company in 2012, WhiteWave sales have increased at a 19 percent compound
annual growth rate through 2015, and WhiteWave has doubled its operating
income during this period.
  Together, WhiteWave and Danone will create a truly unique global leader
committed to addressing tomorrow's consumer trends by providing healthy and
sustainable eating and drinking options.
  ""At Danone, we constantly seek to align our vision of the world, our mission
and our businesses: we believe we have a special responsibility, as

Emmanuel FABER, Danone Chief Executive Officer. ""This unique combination

  This transaction represents a key opportunity to enhance Danone's growth

      high growth categories that are supported by strong secular trends.
      Organic foods and beverages and non-GMO plant-based alternatives to milk

      and yogurt are among the fastest growing categories in the industry.
      WhiteWave has been the fastest growing food and beverage company in the
      United States and one of the fastest growing in Europe for the past four

      years. In joining Danone, WhiteWave will have the opportunity to

of
      brands and products in fresh dairy, organic foods and beverages and
      plant-based alternatives to milk & yogurt.
   -- Building a stronger North America platform: This transaction further
      diversifies Danone's portfolio and broadens its presence in North
      America. The transaction will create a leading U.S. refrigerated dairy
      player, as well as one of the top 15 largest U.S. Food and Beverage
      manufacturers. Following the closing of the transaction, Danone's North
      America footprint would increase from 12 to 22 percent of Danone' total
      portfolio.
   -- Driving strong value and delivering attractive financial benefits. By
      building on its resources, scale, distinctive R&D and marketing
      capabilities, and route to market expertise especially in the chilled
      category, Danone will have significant opportunities to support
      WhiteWave's continued growth while also realizing significant sales
      growth and cost synergies. Danone expects the transaction to be solidly
      accretive to Danone's earnings within the first year after closing and
to
      be above 10 percent accretion based on expected run-rate synergies. The
      transaction is expected to result in approximately $300mn of EBIT
      synergies by 2020.
  Management and Governance
  After the closing of the transaction, Danone will submit to its shareholders
a resolution appointing Mr. Gregg ENGLES, to the Danone Board of Directors.

long term mission for building economic and social value.
  Danone and WhiteWave will establish a team to prepare for and to oversee the
transition of the businesses.
  Path to Completion

It will allow us to enhance Danone's growth profile and reinforce our resilience through a broader platform in North America. We are convinced that combining with WhiteWave will create significant value for all of our stakeholders.""

Strategic Benefits   This transaction represents a key opportunity to enhance Danone's growth profile and enriches WhiteWave's opportunities. The strategic and financial benefits of Danone's acquisition of WhiteWave include:    -- Creating a leader strongly aligned with consumer trends for healthier and       sustainable eating and drinking options: WhiteWave is well positioned in        high growth categories that are supported by strong secular trends.       Organic foods and beverages and non-GMO plant-based alternatives to milk        and yogurt are among the fastest growing categories in the industry.       WhiteWave has been the fastest growing food and beverage company in the       United States and one of the fastest growing in Europe for the past four        years. In joining Danone, WhiteWave will have the opportunity to continue       its industry-leading growth as part of a larger global company with       substantial financial, geographic and operational resources. Upon closing       the transaction, Danone will have one of the most extensive portfolios of       brands and products in fresh dairy, organic foods and beverages and       plant-based alternatives to milk & yogurt.    -- Building a stronger North America platform: This transaction further       diversifies Danone's portfolio and broadens its presence in North       America. The transaction will create a leading U.S. refrigerated dairy       player, as well as one of the top 15 largest U.S. Food and Beverage       manufacturers. Following the closing of the transaction, Danone's North       America footprint would increase from 12 to 22 percent of Danone' total       portfolio.    -- Driving strong value and delivering attractive financial benefits. By       building on its resources, scale, distinctive R&D and marketing       capabilities, and route to market expertise especially in the chilled       category, Danone will have significant opportunities to support       WhiteWave's continued growth while also realizing significant sales       growth and cost synergies. Danone expects the transaction to be solidly       accretive to Danone's earnings within the first year after closing and to       be above 10 percent accretion based on expected run-rate synergies. The       transaction is expected to result in approximately $300mn of EBIT       synergies by 2020.   Management and Governance   After the closing of the transaction, Danone will submit to its shareholders a resolution appointing Mr. Gregg ENGLES, to the Danone Board of Directors.   WhiteWave and Danone uniquely share common business values and a vision for providing people healthier foods and beverages.

This commitment is in line with Danone's long term mission for building economic and social value.   Danone and WhiteWave will establish a team to prepare for and to oversee the transition of the businesses.   Path to Completion   The transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the year, is subject to WhiteWave shareholders approval, receipt of required regulatory approvals, including in the European Union and the United States and other customary closing conditions.   The acquisition of WhiteWave is expected to be fully financed with debt for which Danone has received commitments from its banks.   Danone expects to maintain a strong investment grade rating.   A conference call and presentation webcast for analysts and investors, chaired by Danone's CEO Emmanuel Faber and CFO C&#233;cile Cabanis, and WhiteWave's CEO Gregg Engles will be broadcast live today at 9:00a.m CET on the Investors section of www.danone.com   Related slides will also be available on the corporate website, in the Investors section.

Enbridge Inc. (TSX:ENB) (NYSE:ENB) (Enbridge) and Spectra Energy Corp (NYSE:SE) (Spectra Energy) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Enbridge and Spectra Energy will combine in a stock-for-stock merger transaction (the ""Transaction""), which values Spectra Energy common stock at approximately C$37 billion (US$28 billion), based on the closing price of Enbridge's common shares on September 2, 2016. The combination will create the largest energy infrastructure company in North America and one of the largest globally based on a pro-forma enterprise value of approximately C$165 billion (US$127 billion). The Transaction was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to shareholder and certain regulatory approvals, and other customary conditions.

Under the terms of the Transaction, Spectra Energy shareholders will receive 0.984 shares of the combined company for each share of Spectra Energy common stock they own. The consideration to be received by Spectra Energy shareholders is valued at US$40.33 per Spectra Energy share, based on the closing price of Enbridge common shares on September 2, 2016, representing an approximate 11.5 percent premium to the closing price of Spectra Energy common stock on September 2, 2016. Upon completion of the Transaction, Enbridge shareholders are expected to own approximately 57 percent of the combined company and Spectra Energy shareholders are expected to own approximately 43 percent. The combined company will be called Enbridge Inc.

This combination brings together two highly complementary platforms to create North America's largest energy infrastructure company and meaningfully enhances customer optionality. With an asset base that includes a diverse set of best-in-class assets comprised of crude oil, liquids and natural gas pipelines, terminal and midstream operations, a regulated utility portfolio and renewable power generation, the combined company will be positioned to provide integrated services and first and last mile connectivity to key supply basins and demand markets. On a combined basis for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016, the company would have generated combined revenues in excess of C$40 billion (US$31 billion) and combined Earnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) of C$5.8 billion (US$4.4 billion), and will have the scale, balance sheet strength, financial flexibility and free cash flow to comfortably fund future growth.

""Over the last two years, we've been focused on identifying opportunities that would extend and diversify our asset base and sources of growth beyond 2019,"" said Al Monaco, President and Chief Executive Officer, Enbridge Inc. ""We are accomplishing that goal by combining with the premier natural gas infrastructure company to create a true North American and global energy infrastructure leader. This Transaction is transformational for both companies and results in unmatched scale, diversity and financial flexibility with multiple platforms for organic growth."" 

Greg Ebel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Spectra Energy, who will become chairman of Enbridge following the closing of the Transaction, said, ""The combination of Enbridge and Spectra Energy creates what we believe will be the best, most diversified energy infrastructure company in North America, if not the world. This is an incredible opportunity for both companies and we at Spectra Energy could not be more excited about what it means going forward. Together, the merged company will have what we believe is the finest platform for serving customers in every region of North America and providing investors with the opportunity for superior shareholder returns."" 

Mr. Monaco added, ""Bringing Enbridge and Spectra Energy together makes strong strategic and financial sense, and the all-stock nature of the Transaction provides shareholders of both companies with the opportunity to participate in the significant upside potential of the combined company. With combined secured projects in execution of C$26 billion (US$20 billion) and another C$48 billion (US$37 billion) of projects under development, the Transaction allows us to extend our anticipated 10-12 percent annual dividend growth through 2024. We believe our combination of best-in-class assets, superior growth and strong commercial underpinning of our business will be unrivaled in our sector. Importantly, we will preserve and enhance our shareholder value proposition, which centers on delivering consistent growth with a low-risk business model. 

""This is also a combination of two companies, management and staff that have a shared vision and talented teams that are dedicated to serving customers and providing the energy that people want and need, safely and reliably every day. We look forward to welcoming Spectra Energy employees to Enbridge as we move forward as one company. In building on our existing strengths by joining with Spectra Energy, Enbridge will be very well positioned for future growth and continued value creation.""

Mr. Ebel added, ""The strength of the combined company will support a large capital program to fund the continued development of Spectra Energy's existing, preeminent project inventory in addition to allowing the combined company to compete for and win the most attractive new growth projects - all while maintaining expected strong dividend growth with exceptional coverage. The transaction premium recognizes the strength of Spectra Energy's world-class natural gas pipeline system and significant expansion program, while providing shareholders the opportunity to participate in the unparalleled value creation potential of the combined company. While our assets are largely complementary, our values are shared, and together we will create a best-in-class company for shareholders, employees, customers, and communities alike.""

Compelling Value Proposition 


--  Six leading strategic growth platforms: The combined company brings
    together many of the highest quality energy infrastructure assets in
    North America: liquids and gas pipelines; US and Canadian midstream
    businesses; a top tier regulated utility portfolio; and a growing
    renewable power generation business. A map of the assets of the combined
    entity is available at www.enbridge.com and www.spectraenergy.com.

--  Secure, low-risk commercial structure with stable long-term cash flow
    visibility: 96 percent of pro-forma free cash flow is underpinned by
    long-term commercial agreements (cost-of-service, take-or-pay, of fixed
    fee); 93 percent of customers are strong, investment grade or equivalent
    counterparties; less than 5 percent of combined pro-forma cash flow will
    have direct exposure to commodity price risk.

--  Largest and most secure program of diversified organic growth projects
    in the industry: Together, Enbridge and Spectra Energy bring C$26
    billion (US$20 billion) in secured capital and a C$48 billion (US$37
    billion) inventory of probability weighted projects in development.

--  Strong balance sheet, growing cash flow and access to capital markets to
    fund large capital program: The combination is expected to result in
    sufficient internally generated cash flow to fund growth and improve
    balance sheet strength. Enbridge will have multiple, cost-effective
    funding sources and be even more competitive in capturing opportunities.

--  Attractive dividend yield with visible organic dividend growth: The
    combined company's C$74 billion (US$57 billion) organic growth platform
    is expected to support a highly visible dividend growth rate of 10-12
    percent through 2024, including an anticipated aggregate increase of 15
    percent in 2017 post closing, while maintaining a conservative payout of
    50-60 percent of available cash flow from operations (ACFFO). This
    provides an industry leading total return driven by a strong, low-risk
    dividend yield.

--  Achievable cost synergies: The combination is expected to achieve annual
    run-rate synergies of C$540 million (US$415 million), the majority of
    which should be achieved in the latter part of 2018. In addition,
    approximately C$260 million (US$200 million) of tax savings can be
    achieved through utilization of tax losses commencing in 2019.

--  Complementary businesses, shared culture and values support smooth
    integration: Enbridge and Spectra Energy have similar business and
    operational models, talented teams, common cultures and values,
    including shared commitment to safety, stewardship of the environment,
    meaningful stakeholder engagement and investing in communities.

Upon closing of the Transaction, Al Monaco will continue to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company. Greg Ebel will serve as non-executive Chairman of Enbridge's Board of Directors.

On closing the Enbridge common shares to be issued in connection with the Transaction will be listed on the TSX and NYSE. Spectra Energy common stock will be delisted from the NYSE. 

Financial Considerations

Enbridge expects the Transaction to be neutral to its 12 percent to 14 percent secured ACFFO per share CAGR guidance through the 2014-2019 time period, and strongly additive to its growth beyond that timeframe. Enbridge is committed to maintaining the financial strength of the combined company. The funding program is designed to ensure strengthening of the balance sheet with the objective of maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings. Enbridge expects it will divest of approximately $2 billion of non-core assets over the next 12 months to provide additional financial flexibility.

At closing, Enbridge Energy Partners, LP and Spectra Energy Partners, LP are expected to continue to be publicly traded partnerships headquartered in Houston, Texas. Enbridge Income Fund Holdings will remain a publicly traded corporation headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. 

Timing and Approvals

The Transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017 subject to the receipt of both companies' shareholder approvals, along with certain regulatory and government approvals, including compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and approval under Canada Competition Act, and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.

Synchronoss expects to finance the Intralinks acquisition with its existing cash, proceeds from the Sequential Technology transaction, and $900 million of new debt. 

Given the expected closing in the first calendar quarter of 2017, Synchronoss expects the Intralinks transaction to have no impact to its fourth quarter financials. With the impact from the Sequential Technology divestiture and assuming a late first quarter 2017 close on the Intralinks deal, Synchronoss is giving initial 2017 revenue guidance of between $810 million and $820 million with pro forma EPS of between $2.45 and $2.60 for the combined entity. We are targeting $40 million of combined synergies within the first year of closing the Intralinks deal. 

The Intralinks transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval in the United States. Until the transaction closes, each company will continue to operate independently.

We look forward to extending U.S. banking services to CIBC's Canadian clients and Atlantic Trust's private wealth clients, in addition to exploring mutual growth opportunities going forward. 

""Additionally, CIBC shares our deep commitment to building stronger communities and we are pleased that we will be able to continue our investments in the important areas of financial education, business development and affordable homeownership. Both CIBC and PrivateBancorp are committed to investing in the community and will work together to continue PrivateBancorp's existing programs and seek opportunities to further make a difference in this important area.""

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa &amp; WELLINGTON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 23, 2016--

  Rockwell Collins (NYSE: COL), a global leader in high-integrity solutions
for aerospace and defense, and B/E Aerospace (NASDAQ: BEAV), the world's
leading manufacturer of aircraft cabin interior products, today announced

and stock, plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in net debt.

  Under the terms of the agreement, each B/E Aerospace shareowner will receive
total consideration of $62.00 per share, comprised of $34.10 per share in
cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins common stock, subject to a
7.5% collar. This represents a premium of 22.5% to the closing price of B/E
Aerospace common stock on Friday, October 21, 2016.
  The transaction combines Rockwell Collins' capabilities in flight deck
avionics, cabin electronics, mission communications, simulation and
training, and information management systems with B/E Aerospace's range of
cabin interior products, which include seating, food and beverage
preparation and storage equipment, lighting and oxygen systems, and modular
galley and lavatory systems for commercial airliners and business jets.
  The acquisition significantly increases Rockwell Collins' scale and
diversifies its product portfolio, customer mix and geographic presence. On
a pro forma basis, Rockwell Collins would have nearly 30,000 employees, $8.1
billion in revenues and $1.9 billion in EBITDA for the twelve months ending
September 30, 2016.
  ""This transformational acquisition is consistent with our strategy to
accelerate growth and build value through market-leading positions in
cockpit and cabin solutions,"" said Kelly Ortberg, Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer of Rockwell Collins. ""We see tremendous opportunity
to better serve our commercial aviation, business jet and military customers
through broader offerings.""
  Ortberg continued, ""B/E Aerospace has a leading position in nearly all the
segments it serves and a highly visible, long-cycle backlog. Beyond new
aircraft deliveries, its $12 billion installed base provides a strong flow
of aftermarket retrofit opportunities that balances our current cyclical
exposure to OEM production rates. Additionally, our combined portfolio
uniquely positions us to integrate cabin products, smart network
technologies and connectivity solutions to significantly enhance aircraft
uptime and airline profitability while improving the experience of
passengers and airline personnel.""
  Ortberg added, ""We expect to generate significant run-rate cost synergies
and over $6 billion in free cash flow over the next five years with expected
free cash flow conversion of greater than 100 percent. In addition, by
leveraging our respective airline and OEM relationships, as well as Rockwell
Collins' business jet dealer network and military aircraft positions, we
firmly believe there are revenue synergies that create meaningful upside to
our business case.""
  B/E Aerospace Founder and Chairman, Amin Khoury, stated, ""Our combination
with Rockwell Collins represents an excellent outcome for B/E Aerospace's
stockholders, who will receive an immediate premium as well as a substantial
equity interest in a strong combined company with a broader range of
products, customers, and the combined expertise and resources to create
future value. We feel confident that this combination delivers significant
long-term benefits neither company could realize on its own. We look forward
to becoming part of Rockwell Collins and leveraging their technology to
accelerate our long-term growth as we embark on the next chapter in the
company's history.""
  Ortberg concluded, ""I'm excited to welcome B/E Aerospace's talented
employees and bring together two industry leaders with complementary
capabilities and strong reputations for innovation, quality and delivering
sustained customer value.""
  Significant cost synergies and additional benefits
  The transaction is expected to generate run-rate pre-tax cost synergies of
approximately $160 million ($125 million after tax). In addition, Rockwell
Collins expects to make certain conforming purchase accounting adjustments
resulting in improved pre-tax earnings of approximately $60 to $90 million
per year for the first six years after the acquisition. The transaction is
expected to be double-digit accretive to earnings per share in the first
full fiscal year.
  Transaction Terms and Financing
  Under the terms of the agreement, B/E Aerospace shareholders will receive
$34.10 per share in cash and a number of Rockwell Collins shares of common
stock equal to $27.90, with such number of shares of Rockwell Collins common
stock determined based on the volume weighted average closing price of
Rockwell Collins common stock for the 20 trading days ending on the day
prior to closing (provided that this volume weighted average price is no
less than $77.41 and no greater than $89.97 per share). If the volume
weighted average price of Rockwell Collins common stock during this period
is above $89.97, the stock portion of the consideration will be fixed at
0.3101 shares of Rockwell Collins common stock for each share of B/E
Aerospace, and if it is below $77.41 per share, the stock portion of the
consideration will be fixed at 0.3604 shares of Rockwell Collins common
stock for each share of B/E Aerospace.
  Upon completion of the transaction, which is expected in the spring of 2017,
current B/E Aerospace shareowners will own approximately 20 percent of the
combined company.
  Rockwell Collins expects to finance the cash portion of the transaction with
debt financing, a significant portion of which has been committed. Upon
completion of the transaction, Rockwell Collins is expected to maintain a
strong investment grade credit rating with net debt of approximately $7.5
billion, and plans to maintain its current dividend policy. Rockwell Collins
intends to pay down $1.5 billion of the new debt by the end of its fiscal
2019 while curtailing its share repurchase program to a level sufficient to
offset dilution.
  The transaction, which was unanimously approved by the boards of directors
of both companies, is subject to the approval of Rockwell Collins and B/E
Aerospace shareowners, regulatory approvals and other customary conditions.
  Governance
  Upon close of the transaction, Rockwell Collins will increase the size of
its Board to 11 members with the addition of two B/E Aerospace board
members. Werner Lieberherr, CEO of B/E Aerospace, will become Executive Vice
President and Chief Operating Officer of a newly created aircraft interior
systems segment for Rockwell Collins.

Combined Company will Own and Operate 20 Regional Gaming Facilities in Ten States 


Eldorado Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ: ERI) (“Eldorado,” “ERI,” or “the Company”) and Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISLE) (“Isle of Capri” or ""Isle"") announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby Eldorado will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Isle of Capri for $23.00 in cash or 1.638 shares of Eldorado common stock, at the election of each Isle of Capri shareholder, reflecting total consideration of approximately $1.7 billion, inclusive of $929 million of long-term debt of Isle of Capri and its subsidiaries. The exchange ratio for stock consideration to be issued in the merger is fixed and was determined based on Eldorado’s 30-trading day volume weighted average price as of September 18, 2016 of $14.04. Elections are subject to proration such that the outstanding shares of Isle common stock will be exchanged for aggregate consideration comprised of 58% cash and 42% Eldorado common stock. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Eldorado’s free cash flow and diluted earnings per share, inclusive of identified cost synergies of approximately $35 million in the first year following the completion of the transaction and giving effect to Isle’s previously announced divestiture of Isle of Capri Casino Hotel Lake Charles. The transaction consideration represents an approximate 36% premium over the closing share price of Isle of Capri on September 16, 2016. 

Following the completion of the transaction, Eldorado will benefit from increased operational and geographic diversity as it will add thirteen casino–resorts to its portfolio, for a total of 20 properties in ten states. After giving effect to the completion of the transaction and the sale of Isle of Capri Casino Hotel Lake Charles, the combined operations of Eldorado and Isle would have generated approximately $1.8 billion in revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2016. Eldorado’s expanded property portfolio will feature approximately 20,800 slot machines and VLTs, more than 560 table games and over 6,500 hotel rooms. No single market accounted for more than 15% of the combined entity’s Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve month periods ended the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter for each of Eldorado and Isle. 

Gary Carano, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Eldorado, commented, “The acquisition of Isle of Capri represents a transformational growth opportunity for Eldorado and is a significant milestone in the successful ongoing execution of our long-term strategy to opportunistically expand our regional gaming platform through accretive acquisitions. In the last two years we have created tremendous value for our shareholders as the scale of Eldorado Resorts will grow from two wholly-owned properties and a 50% interest in a third property in two markets in 2014 to 20 properties in ten states after completing the transaction. Financially, the transaction is expected to be accretive to our operating results upon closing. For the twelve month periods ended the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter for each of Eldorado and Isle, the revenues of the combined company were almost double Eldorado’s revenues on a standalone basis and combined Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $400 million, inclusive of the cost synergies we have identified. Strategically, the combination builds the scale of our gaming operations and further diversifies the geographic reach of our operations without any overlap with our existing properties. 

“We intend to implement our strategy of focusing on margin enhancement and customer service and experiences across the portfolio by marrying best practices from both companies. Led by our proven gaming, hotel management and food and beverage teams with a long-term record of operating execution and M&A integration we believe that Eldorado Resorts will be positioned for long-term success. Combining the assets, management, personnel, operations and other resources of these two organizations is expected to create substantial near- and long-term synergies."" 

Eric Hausler, Chief Executive Officer of Isle of Capri, added, “We are pleased to reach this agreement with Eldorado Resorts, which provides Isle of Capri shareholders with substantial and immediate value, as well as the opportunity to participate in the upside potential of the combined company. The premium value our shareholders will be receiving reflects the culmination of several years of hard work by many dedicated Isle of Capri employees and the determination and guidance of our Board of Directors in creating and driving value. I am thankful for the hard work and dedication of our talented employees, and I am confident they will continue to make many valuable contributions as part of a larger and stronger organization. I look forward to working closely with the Eldorado team to bring our companies together to realize the benefits of this compelling combination and ensure a smooth transition.” 

Tom Reeg, President and Chief Financial Officer of Eldorado, concluded, “This acquisition marks further progress toward our goal of strategically expanding our property base to realize benefits of scale, increasing long-term strategic and financial flexibility, and driving shareholder value. Our experience and success over the last two years in integrating the MTR assets and Silver Legacy and Circus Circus operations will serve us well as we add the Isle of Capri assets to our operating base. With our experienced management team, operating discipline and return-focused approach to capital expenditures, we believe the acquisition of Isle of Capri offers a meaningful opportunity for Eldorado Resorts, our shareholders and Isle shareholders. Notably, after giving effect to the transaction, the incurrence of debt to fund the cash portion of the purchase price, transaction expenses, and the expected first year cost synergies of $35 million, we expect our net leverage ratio to be approximately 5.1x at closing. We plan to use the free cash flow expected to be generated by the combined company to reduce leverage and pursue future growth opportunities.” 

Eldorado has received committed financing for the transaction totaling $2.1 billion from J.P. Morgan. The completion of the transaction is not subject to a financing contingency. 

The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Eldorado Resorts, Inc. and Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. The transaction is subject to approval of the stockholders of Eldorado Resorts and Isle of Capri, the approval of applicable gaming authorities, the expiration of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to be consummated in the second quarter of 2017. Certain stockholders of Eldorado and Isle of Capri who control approximately 24% and 35% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Eldorado and Isle of Capri, respectively, have signed agreements to vote in favor of the transaction. Upon completion of the transaction, Eldorado and Isle of Capri shareholders will hold approximately 62% and 38%, respectively, of the combined company’s outstanding shares. In addition, subject to mutual agreement by both companies, two members of the Isle of Capri Board of Directors will be designated as members of the Eldorado Board of Directors effective immediately following the closing of the transaction. 

J.P. Morgan is acting as exclusive financial advisor and Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy LLP is acting as legal counsel to Eldorado in connection with the proposed transaction. Credit Suisse is acting as exclusive financial advisor and Mayer Brown LLP is acting as legal counsel to Isle of Capri in connection with the proposed transaction.

      Covers Methods for Using Modified T cells Containing scFv Binding
      Elements and Other Key CAR-T Features
SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 19, 2016--
  Kite Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq:KITE) today announced several updates to its broad
intellectual property portfolio relating to the use of chimeric antigen
receptors (CARs) to harness the power of a patient's immune cells. These
updates include a recent U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) decision
concerning one narrow patent related to CAR products containing a
pre-specified CD28 costimulatory domain, and a recent favorable result in a
challenge at the USPTO to one of Kite's important CAR-T patents, U.S. Patent
Number 6,319,494.
  In August 2015, Kite preemptively filed a petition with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) to institute an inter partes review (IPR) of U.S.
Patent No. 7,446,190 owned by Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research
and licensed by Juno Therapeutics, Inc. The IPR was aimed at invalidating
the '190 patent, which has a narrow scope directed to CAR products
containing a pre-specified CD28 costimulatory domain. The USPTO's recent
ruling in this matter did not revoke the patent. However, Kite continues to
believe the patent to be invalid and plans to appeal the USPTO decision to
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. This patent does not have
any counterpart patents outside of the United States.
  The USPTO's decision will have no impact on the timing of the rolling
submission or review of the Biologics License Application for Kite's lead
product candidate, axicabtagene ciloleucel (KTE-C19), a potentially
lifesaving investigational therapy that has demonstrated the most advanced
utilization of the CD28 costimulatory domain in a CAR-T therapy to date.
Axicabtagene ciloleucel is currently being developed for the treatment of
CD19 positive B cell malignancies, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute
lymphoblastic leukemia.
  Separately, Kite recently defeated an anonymous challenge filed against U.S.
Patent Number 6,319,494, developed by Kite's Senior Vice President of
Discovery Research, Margo Roberts, Ph.D. and colleagues. This patent, which
covers methods for treating a viral disease or malignancy using modified T
cells that contain single-chain variable fragment (scFv) binding elements
and other key CAR-T features, impacts multiple competitor CAR-T cell product
candidates under development.
  In addition to the Roberts patent, Kite's growing intellectual property
portfolio encompasses more than 150 patent assets including an exclusive
license to U.S. Patent No. 7,741,465, a leading and widely significant
patent directed to CAR-T constructs, developed by Dr. Zelig Eshhar and
colleagues. This patent, currently under reexam by the USPTO, potentially
impacts CAR-T products under development by multiple Kite competitors.

Rudolph Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: RTEC) announced today that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has issued a ruling regarding Camtek Ltd.’s requested reexamination of Rudolph’s U.S. Patent No. 7,729,528. The ‘528 patent is the subject of Rudolph’s patent infringement lawsuit against Camtek’s inspection systems which is currently stayed pending the resolution of the re-examination process.

As background, in December of 2011, Rudolph filed a complaint against Camtek asserting that Camtek’s Condor and Gannet inspection systems infringed Rudolph’s ‘528 patent. Camtek responded by filing an inter partes reexamination petition regarding the ‘528 patent with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”). Based on the parties’ agreement, the Court stayed the lawsuit pending the outcome of the reexamination process. Of the ‘528 patent’s 53 claims, reexamination was instituted on 18. Rudolph later appealed the PTO’s decision to reject the 18 reexamined patent claims to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

Today’s ruling by the Court of Appeals reversed the PTO’s rejection of three of the 18 patent claims and affirmed the PTO’s rejection of nine patent claims. The appeal of the remaining six patent claims was dismissed by the Court of Appeals for procedural reasons.

“We are pleased that the Federal Court of Appeals reversed the Patent and Trademark Office’s decision regarding the rejection of three claims of the ‘528 patent. We believe these claims, along with the other claims which were not rejected as part of the reexamination process, will form a solid basis by which we will ultimately prevail in the associated litigation,” commented Robert Koch, Rudolph’s vice president and general counsel. “It is our estimation that the claims which remain rejected were not essential for Rudolph’s success in the litigation as the remaining claims are fully sufficient to hold Camtek accountable, once again, for its use of our patented technology in its tool offerings.”

The Court of Appeals ruling is subject to each party’s right to request reconsideration. Thereafter, upon finalization of the decision, the stay in the litigation will likely be lifted. Rudolph continues to assert its intellectual property rights against Camtek to ensure that their prohibited use of Rudolph’s proprietary, patented technology ends. Rudolph prevailed with collecting a $14.6 million patent infringement judgment against Camtek earlier this year involving U.S. Patent No. 6,826,298 and is also actively prosecuting an additional lawsuit against Camtek over their Eagle products under that patent. In this further lawsuit, Rudolph is again seeking both monetary damages and a permanent injunction against the sale of the Eagle systems in the United States.

  Stock Exchange Release
  December 21, 2016 at 20:08 (CET +1)
  Nokia sues Apple in Europe and the US for infringement of Nokia patents
  Espoo, Finland - Nokia announced that it has today filed a number of
complaints against Apple in Germany and the US, alleging that Apple products
infringe a number of Nokia patents.
  As one of the world's leading innovators, and following the acquisition of
full ownership of NSN in 2013 and Alcatel-Lucent in 2016, Nokia now owns
three valuable portfolios of intellectual property. Built on more than EUR
115 billion invested in R&D over the past twenty years, our tens of
thousands of patents cover many important technologies used in smartphones,
tablets, personal computers and similar devices.
  Since agreeing a license covering some patents from the Nokia Technologies
portfolio in 2011, Apple has declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to
license other of its patented inventions which are used by many of Apple's
products.
  Ilkka Rahnasto, head of Patent Business at Nokia, said: ""Through our
sustained investment in research and development, Nokia has created or
contributed to many of the fundamental technologies used in today's mobile
devices, including Apple products. After several years of negotiations
trying to reach agreement to cover Apple's use of these patents, we are now
taking action to defend our rights.""
  These actions have been filed with the Regional Courts in Dusseldorf,
Mannheim and Munich in Germany and the US District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas, with 32 patents in suit across all of the actions,
covering technologies such as display, user interface, software, antenna,
chipsets and video coding. Nokia is in the process of filing further actions
in other jurisdictions.

After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple's use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights.""   These actions have been filed with the Regional Courts in Dusseldorf, Mannheim and Munich in Germany and the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, with 32 patents in suit across all of the actions, covering technologies such as display, user interface, software, antenna, chipsets and video coding. Nokia is in the process of filing further actions in other jurisdictions.   About Nokia   Nokia is a global leader in creating the technologies at the heart of our connected world. Powered by the research and innovation of Nokia Bell Labs, we serve communications service providers, governments, large enterprises and consumers, with the industry's most complete, end-to-end portfolio of products, services and licensing.   From the enabling infrastructure for 5G and the Internet of Things, to emerging applications in virtual reality and digital health, we are shaping the future of technology to transform the human experience. www.nokia.com ",,

  About RAVICTI(R)
  RAVICTI is indicated for use as a nitrogen-binding agent for chronic
management of adult and pediatric patients >=2 years of age with urea cycle
disorders (UCDs) who cannot be managed by dietary protein restriction and/or
amino acid supplementation alone.  RAVICTI must be used with dietary protein
restriction and, in some cases, dietary supplements (e.g., essential amino
acids, arginine, citrulline and protein-free calorie supplements).  RAVICTI
is indicated for use in all 28 Member States of the European Union and 3
Member States of the European Economic Area as a nitrogen-binding agent for
chronic management of adult and pediatric patients two months of age and
older with UCDs who cannot be managed by dietary protein restriction and/or
amino acid supplementation alone.  RAVICTI is indicated for use in Canada as
an adjunctive therapy for chronic management of adult and pediatric patients
two years of age and older with UCDs.
  Important Safety Information
  LIMITATIONS OF USE:
   -- RAVICTI is not indicated for the treatment of acute hyperammonemia in
      patients with UCDs because more rapidly acting interventions are
      essential to reduce plasma ammonia levels

   -- The safety and efficacy of RAVICTI for the treatment of
N-acetylglutamate
      synthase (NAGS) deficiency has not been established

   -- The use of RAVICTI in patients <2 months of age is contraindicated
  CONTRAINDICATIONS:
   -- In patients less than 2 months of age

   -- In patients who develop or have known hypersensitivity to phenylbutyrate

  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:
   -- Phenylacetate (PAA), the major metabolite of RAVICTI, may be toxic at
      levels >=500 ug/mL.  Reduce RAVICTI dosage if symptoms of neurotoxicity,

      including vomiting, nausea, headache, somnolence, confusion, or
      sleepiness are present in the absence of high ammonia or other
      intercurrent illnesses.

   -- Low or absent pancreatic enzymes or intestinal disease resulting in fat
      malabsorption may result in reduced or absent digestion of RAVICTI
and/or
      absorption of phenylbutyrate and reduced control of plasma ammonia.
      Monitor ammonia levels closely.

   -- RAVICTI should be used with caution in patients who are pregnant or
      planning to become pregnant. Based on animal data it may cause fetal
      harm.  A voluntary patient registry will include evaluation of pregnancy

      outcomes in patients with UCDs. For more information regarding the
      registry program, visit www.ucdregistry.com or call 1-855-823-2592.

   -- Caution should be exercised when administering RAVICTI to nursing
mothers,
      as breastfeeding is not recommended with maternal use of RAVICTI.  It is

      not known whether RAVICTI or its metabolites are present in breast milk.

  ADVERSE REACTIONS:
   -- Adverse reactions occurring in >=10% of adult patients during short-term

      treatment (n=44, 4 weeks) with RAVICTI were diarrhea, flatulence, and
      headache.

   -- Adverse reactions occurring in >=10% of adult patients during long-term
      treatment (n=51, 12 months) with RAVICTI were nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea,
      decreased appetite, hyperammonemia, dizziness, headache, and fatigue.

   -- Adverse events occurring in >=10% of pediatric patients during long-term

      treatment (n=26, 12 months) with RAVICTI were upper abdominal pain,
rash,
      nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, hyperammonemia, and
      headache.
  DRUG INTERACTIONS:
   -- Corticosteroids, valproic acid, or haloperidol:  May increase plasma
      ammonia level. Monitor ammonia levels closely.

   -- Probenecid:  May affect renal excretion of metabolites of RAVICTI,
      including PAGN and PAA.
  About Urea Cycle Disorders (UCDs)
  Urea Cycle Disorders or UCDs are inherited metabolic diseases caused by a
deficiency of one of the enzymes or transporters that constitute the urea
cycle.  The urea cycle involves a series of biochemical steps in which
ammonia, a potent neurotoxin, is converted to urea, which is excreted in the
urine.  UCD patients may experience episodes where they get symptoms from
the ammonia in their blood being excessively high -- called hyperammonemic
crises -- which may result in irreversible brain damage, coma or death.  UCD
symptoms may first occur at any age depending on the severity of the
disorder, with more severe defects presenting earlier in life.
