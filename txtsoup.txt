 talen energy to be acquired by riverstone   stockholders to receive $14.00 per share in cash   transaction has total enterprise value of approximately $5.2 billion   pr newswire   allentown, pa., june 3, 2016   allentown, pa., june 3, 2016 /prnewswire/ -- talen energy corporation (nyse: tln), a competitive energy and power generation company that owns or controls 16,000 megawatts of capacity in eight states, announced today that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with affiliates of riverstone holdings llc ("riverstone"), a private investment firm.   under terms of the merger agreement, all outstanding shares of talen energy common stock not currently owned by riverstone affiliated entities will be acquired for $14.00 per share in cash. affiliates of riverstone currently own approximately 35 percent of the outstanding shares of talen energy common stock, which were issued in the june 2015 transaction that established talen energy by combining competitive generation assets that had been owned by affiliates of ppl corporation and affiliates of riverstone.   the purchase price represents a 56 percent premium to the closing price of $9.00 per share on march 31, 2016, the last trading day before public reports of a potential sale of talen energy, and a 101 percent premium to the 60-day volume-weighted average price of $6.95 per share through march 31.   the transaction has a total enterprise value of approximately $5.2 billion.   "we believe the transaction offers compelling value to our stockholders, while eliminating execution risk, and will provide additional momentum to the outstanding work our employees have done to drive improvements in the safety, reliability and efficiency of our plants in the time since we became an independent company," said paul farr, talen energy president and chief executive officer.   "the disinterested directors of the board, not including the two riverstone directors, with the assistance of our financial and legal advisors, carefully analyzed riverstone's offer, and after extensive negotiation and thorough consideration, concluded that the agreement we are announcing today is in the best interests of our stockholders," said stuart e. graham, chairman of talen energy's board of directors.   david m. leuschen and pierre f. lapeyre, jr., co-founders of riverstone, added, "as an experienced owner of power generation assets, riverstone is excited to acquire talen energy and its world class generating fleet, which is located in some of the united states' most attractive power markets."   'go shop'   the agreement provides for a "go-shop" period, during which talen energy -- with the assistance of its legal and financial advisors -- may actively solicit, receive, evaluate and potentially enter into negotiations with parties that offer alternative proposals. the go-shop period is 40 days. talen energy will be permitted to continue discussions with certain parties that make a qualifying offer during the go-shop period for an additional 20 days and, subject to customary requirements included in the agreement, enter into or recommend a transaction with a person or group that makes a superior proposal. the agreement provides for the payment of a termination fee by talen energy to riverstone in the event that the agreement is terminated for a superior proposal, which termination fee will be $50 million, but which will be reduced to $25 million if talen energy accepts a superior proposal made during the go-shop period.   there can be no assurance that this process will result in a superior proposal. talen energy does not intend to disclose developments during this process unless and until the board makes a decision with respect to any superior proposal it may receive.   stockholder and regulatory approval   in addition to approval by stockholders representing a majority of outstanding shares of common stock, the transaction is subject to approval by a majority of non- riverstone affiliated stockholders voting at a special stockholder meeting to be scheduled. riverstone and its affiliates have agreed to vote their 35 percent stake in favor of the proposed transaction.   the transaction is subject to expiration of the applicable waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act, approval of the nuclear regulatory commission and the federal energy regulatory commission, as well as certain other customary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. riverstone's obligation to consummate the transaction is also subject to talen energy having a minimum amount of cash and revolving credit facility capacity available at closing.   the parties currently expect the transaction to be completed by the end of 2016.   transaction financing   the consideration for the common stock in the transaction, of approximately $1.8 billion, is expected to be funded by a conversion of riverstone's existing ownership of 35 percent of the common stock of talen into shares of the surviving corporation, talen energy's cash on hand, and proceeds of a $250 million new secured term loan.  the new secured term loan is fully committed by goldman sachs bank usa, royal bank of canada, barclays bank plc, credit suisse ag and credit suisse securities (usa) llc, deutsche bank securities inc. and deutsche bank ag new york branch, morgan stanley senior funding inc., and the bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj ltd., and will rank pari-passu with the existing first lien revolving credit facility of talen energy supply llc (a wholly owned subsidiary of talen energy) ("energy supply"), which will be reduced from $1.85 billion to $1.4 billion upon closing of the transaction. concurrently with the signing of the merger agreement, all of energy supply's subsidiaries that currently guarantee its revolving credit facility have executed guarantees (effective as of the closing of the transaction) of talen energy's outstanding unsecured notes due 2025 ("2025 notes") and its pennsylvania economic development financing authority revenue bonds ("municipal bonds"), which together comprise approximately $831 million of energy supply's approximately $3.3 billion total unsecured debt that will remain outstanding. as a result of this new credit support for the 2025 notes and the municipal bonds, it is expected that these notes and bonds will be structurally senior to the non-guaranteed unsecured debt of energy supply, and we believe that the issue ratings on the 2025 notes and the municipal bonds will be maintained or improved.   financial and legal advisors   citi is serving as financial advisor to

amsurg shares per envision share. the combined organization will have a pro forma market capitalization of approximately $10 billion and enterprise value of approximately $15 billion based on the closing stock prices of envision and amsurg on june 14, 2016. envision shareholders will own approximately 53% percent and amsurg shareholders will own approximately 47% percent of the combined

toms river, n.j. and ocean city, n.j., july 13, 2016 (globe newswire) -- oceanfirst financial corp. (‚Äúoceanfirst‚Äù) (nasdaq:ocfc), headquartered in toms river, new jersey, and ocean shore holding co. (‚Äúocean shore‚Äù) (nasdaq:oshc), headquartered in ocean city, new jersey, jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which ocean shore, the holding company and parent of ocean city home bank, will merge with and into oceanfirst, the holding company and parent of oceanfirst bank. ocean city home bank will also merge with and into oceanfirst bank. the transaction is valued at approximately $22.47 per ocean shore common share or approximately $145.6 million in the aggregate.   ocean shore logo.jpg         with roots dating back to 1887, ocean city home bank is one of southern new jersey‚Äôs oldest and largest community banks with approximately $1.1 billion in total assets, $818 million in total deposits and $796 million in gross loans. ocean shore operates 11 full-service banking centers in atlantic and cape may counties. following oceanfirst‚Äôs recently completed acquisition of cape bancorp, inc., the proposed transaction will further enrich oceanfirst‚Äôs distribution, scale and core deposit funding base, as it presents an exceptionally rare opportunity to combine two well-established, like-minded new jersey franchises.  oceanfirst will strengthen its position as the largest bank headquartered in central and southern new jersey and rank as the fourth largest new jersey based banking institution by deposit market share.  based on financial information as of march 31, 2016, and pro forma for the cape transaction, the combined institution would have approximately $5.3 billion in total assets, $4.0 billion in total deposits, $4.0 billion in gross loans and 61 full-service banking locations.  under the terms of the merger agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, upon completion of the merger, shareholders of ocean shore common stock will be entitled to receive $4.35 in cash and 0.9667 shares of oceanfirst common stock for each share of ocean shore common stock. the transaction is expected to close late fourth quarter of 2016 or early first quarter of 2017, subject to each company receiving the required approval of its shareholders, receipt of all required regulatory approvals and fulfillment of other customary closing conditions.  the purchase price equates to 132% of ocean shore‚Äôs march 31, 2016 tangible book value, 4.9% premium to core deposits, 20.1x ocean shore‚Äôs trailing twelve month earnings, and 9.3x ocean shore‚Äôs estimated 2017 (forward) earnings (assuming fully phased-in cost savings). tangible book value per common share is expected to be diluted by approximately 3.1% at closing with a projected earnback period of approximately 3.7 years using the cross-over1 method.  the transaction includes strong earnings per share accretion of approximately 5.4% in 2018 (the first full year of combined operations and synergies) in addition to the projected double-digit earnings accretion from the cape bancorp, inc. transaction. the combined company will be structured to support enhanced financial return targets of greater than 1.05% return on average assets and greater than 13.0% return on average tangible common equity along with remaining ‚Äúwell-capitalized‚Äù under regulatory guidelines.  oceanfirst expects to incur pre-tax merger and integration costs of approximately $19 million and to achieve cost savings of approximately 53% of ocean shore‚Äôs non-interest expenses or $12.4 million if 2017 cost savings were to be fully phased in.   ‚Äúwe are excited to welcome ocean city home bank customers and employees to the oceanfirst family. our two institutions have developed our respective community banks with a consistent vision, effectively sharing similar histories.  with our mutual understanding of our community bank business models and local market focus, oceanfirst and ocean shore can leverage this synergy to create one of the most highly valued banking institutions in the mid-atlantic region,‚Äù said christopher d. maher, president and chief executive officer of oceanfirst.  mr. maher further commented, ‚Äúthis transaction represents a unique opportunity for oceanfirst to capitalize on its recent entry into southern new jersey through the acquisition of an extremely valuable deposit franchise coupled with significant efficiencies and low execution risk. ocean shore‚Äôs residential focus creates strategic optionality for prudent commercial real estate growth with strong cash flows.  we look forward to continuing to provide extraordinary customer care to all oceanfirst and ocean shore customers, as well as providing enhanced value to our stockholders.‚Äù  steven e. brady, president and chief executive officer of ocean shore, echoed mr. maher‚Äôs comments stating, ‚Äúthe combination with oceanfirst provides several strategic benefits for all ocean shore stakeholders, including improved operating scale, access to additional product lines and increased shareholder liquidity.‚Äù  mr. brady added that ‚Äúwhile this merger solidifies the pro forma bank‚Äôs jersey shore dominance, it also provides ocean

definitive merger agreement providing for breeze-eastern to become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of transdigm. transdigm and breeze-eastern both design, manufacture and supply highly engineered aircraft components.  under the terms of the agreement, a subsidiary of transdigm will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of breeze-eastern common stock for $19.61 per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $206 million. following the purchase of shares through the tender offer, transdigm will complete the transaction by acquiring all remaining shares not acquired in the offer through a merger at the same price as the tender offer.  the transaction will be funded with transdigm's cash on hand and is not subject to any financing condition. the merger agreement was unanimously approved by the board of directors of breeze-eastern.  w. nicholas howley, chairman and chief executive officer of transdigm, stated, "breeze-eastern pioneered the technology for helicopter rescue hoists and cargo winches and subsequently became a leading global designer and manufacturer of highly engineered, proprietary rescue hoists, winches and cargo hooks, as well as weapons-handling systems equipment, which currently can be found on all types of military and civilian aircraft.  major customers include sikorsky, boeing, agustawestland, airbus and the us government, serving such platforms as the uh-60 blackhawk, ch-47 chinook, airbus a400m transport, hh-65 dolphin and aw-139 series helicopter. about 75% of breeze-eastern's total revenue is derived from military markets and 70% from aftermarket products, with the vast majority being from proprietary products. we are pleased to have an agreement to acquire breeze-eastern given that the proprietary nature of these products, along with significant aftermarket content, fits well with our overall business strategy."  brad pedersen, breeze-eastern's president and ceo, added, "we believe breeze-eastern will be an excellent addition to the transdigm portfolio of companies, as our products, business model, strategy and focus are closely aligned.  being part of a larger aerospace company will allow for further growth opportunities and provide resources for breeze-eastern to continue developing the highly engineered life-saving products that we're known for today.  on account of this, we believe the transaction positions breeze-eastern well for the future and is good news for breeze-eastern's stockholders, employees, customers and suppliers.   we are proud of our history and accomplishments and look forward to our future together with transdigm."  under the terms of the merger agreement, the parties anticipate that transdigm will commence a cash tender offer for all

transaction, valued at $12.2 billion, creates leading midwest electric utility better positioned to serve customers and meet the region‚Äôs energy needs.  great plains energy incorporated (nyse: gxp), the parent company of kcp&l, and westar energy, inc. (nyse: wr), today announced a definitive agreement for great plains energy to acquire westar in a combined cash and stock transaction with an enterprise value of approximately $12.2 billion, including total equity value of approximately $8.6 billion. upon closing, westar will become a wholly owned subsidiary of great plains energy.  once the transaction is complete, great plains energy will have more than 1.5 million customers in kansas and missouri, nearly 13,000 megawatts of generation capacity, almost 10,000 miles of transmission lines and over 51,000 miles of distribution lines. in addition, more than 45 percent of the combined utility‚Äôs retail customer demand can be met with emission-free energy.  ‚Äúwestar and kcp&l are trusted neighbors and have worked together for generations in kansas. the combination of our two companies is the best fit for meeting our region‚Äôs energy needs,‚Äù said terry bassham, chairman and chief executive officer of great plains energy and kcp&l. ‚Äúthis is an important transaction for kansas and our entire region. by combining our two companies, we are keeping ownership local and management responsive to regulators, customers and regional needs, while enhancing our ability to build long-term value for shareholders.‚Äù  currently, great plains energy and westar jointly own and operate the wolf creek nuclear generating station, as well as the la cygne and jeffrey power plants. with the addition of westar‚Äôs generation fleet, great plains energy will have a more diverse and sustainable generation portfolio. this will provide increased flexibility to mitigate the potential customer impacts from future carbon regulation. in addition, among investor-owned utilities in the united states, the combined company will have one of the largest portfolios of wind generation in the country.  ‚Äúthis is an important day for westar, our customers, employees, shareholders, the communities we support and for the state of kansas,‚Äù said mark ruelle, president and chief executive officer of westar. ‚Äúour commitment to reliability, customer satisfaction, safety and sustainability is consistent with great plains energy‚Äôs values, which makes them our ideal partner. we‚Äôre eager to join the great plains energy team, and excited about this new chapter that combines the unique strengths of our respective organizations to form an even stronger company for our state.‚Äù  great plains energy has an established track record of successful integration with aacent electric utilities. in 2008, great plains energy completed its acquisition of aquila, an electric utility serving customers in aacent areas of missouri. that successful acquisition has delivered ‚Äì and continues to deliver ‚Äì significant savings for customers, which exceeded initial expectations and was reviewed and approved by both the missouri public service commission and the kansas corporation commission.  ‚Äúthe utility industry is facing rising customer expectations, increasing environmental standards and emerging cyber security threats. these factors, coupled with slower demand growth for electricity, are driving our costs and customer rates higher. our acquisition of westar will create operational efficiencies and future cost savings that will benefit all involved ‚Äì customers, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve. these savings also will help reduce future rate increase requests,‚Äù said bassham. ‚Äúcombining our two companies will result in cost savings and operational benefits for our more than 900,000 kansas and 600,000 missouri customers.‚Äù  transaction terms and financing profile  under the terms of the agreement, which was unanimously approved by the boards of directors for both companies, westar shareholders will receive $60.00 per share of total consideration for each share of westar common stock, consisting of $51.00 in cash and $9.00 in great plains energy common stock, subject to a 7.5 percent collar based upon the great plains energy common stock price at the time of the closing of the transaction, with the exchange ratio for the stock consideration ranging between 0.2709 to 0.3148 shares of great plains energy common stock for each westar share of common stock, representing a consideration mix of 85 percent cash and 15 percent stock.  the transaction enterprise value is expected to be approximately $12.2 billion, inclusive of approximately $8.6 billion in total stock and cash consideration to be received by westar‚Äôs shareholders and the assumption of approximately $3.6 billion in westar‚Äôs debt. great plains energy has secured approximately $8.0 billion of committed debt financing from goldman sachs bank usa and goldman sachs lending partners llc in connection with the transaction for the full cash portion of the transaction consideration. great plains energy has also secured a $750 million mandatorily preferred convertible equity commitment from the ontario municipal employees retirement system (omers), to be funded at the closing of the transaction. great plains energy plans to issue long-term financing consisting of a combination of equity, equity-linked securities and debt prior to closing of the transaction. this financing mix will allow great plains energy to maintain its solid, investment grade credit ratings.  great plains energy expects savings generated from combining the two companies to be consistent with recent comparable transactions, and its own recent experience. great plains energy expects the acquisition will be neutral to earnings-per-share in the first full calendar year of operations and significantly accretive thereafter. the long-term earnings growth target of the combined company is expected to grow to six to eight percent‚Äîbetter than either company on a standalone basis.  leadership and headquarters  upon completion of the transaction, bassham will be chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company. ruelle will remain in his current role with westar until the closing of the transaction. in addition, great plains energy will add one director from the westar board of directors to the great plains energy board of directors.  ‚Äúwe understand the importance of westar to the communities it serves and the meaningful contributions it makes as a major employer in kansas,‚Äù said bassham. ‚Äúwe are committed to maintaining the operating headquarters for our kansas service territory in downtown topeka. we also know that westar has a reputation as a strong supporter of community and charitable initiatives. we will continue this legacy and are committed to maintaining a strong presence in all of the communities westar serves.‚Äù  sustainability  customers today expect their utility providers to identify and advance energy efficiency options that give them greater control and choice. the combined company will have a greater, more diverse portfolio of energy solutions that give customers the opportunities to better manage their individual energy needs. in addition, great plains energy operates the nation‚Äôs largest utility-owned electric vehicle charging network, which can be expanded to benefit westar‚Äôs customers.  regulatory approval  the companies anticipate making the required regulatory filings with the kansas corporation commission and other regulatory entities during june and july of 2016. in addition, great plains energy and westar will seek shareholder approvals later this year. the transaction is subject to approvals from the federal energy regulatory commission and the nuclear regulatory commission. the transaction also is subject to the notification, clearance and reporting requirements under the hart-scott-rodino act by the federal trade commission and the us department of justice. the companies anticipate closing in the spring of 2017. in the coming months, the companies will work together to develop a robust integration plan.  advisors  goldman, sachs & co. served as the exclusive financial advisor and bracewell llp served as legal advisor

     salesforce.com inc. said it won't pursue a bid for twitter inc., ending weeks of speculation and sending shares of the social-media company down 6.4%.      salesforce chief executive marc benioff in recent weeks had signaled his interest in twitter to investors. at a company conference last week, he called twitter an " unpolished jewel."      but salesforce investors reacted negatively to the idea, sending salesforce shares down almost 6% on oct. 5.      the stock move, and other feedback from investors, seemed to trigger second thoughts at salesforce about the wisdom of a bid.      the financial times reported earlier friday that salesforce was no longer interested in twitter. "it wasn't the right fit for us," the paper quoted mr. benioff as saying.      a salesforce spokeswoman confirmed that the company wouldn't make a bid for twitter. salesforce shares rose 6.2% following the news.      a twitter spokeswoman declined to comment.      salesforce.com maintains a long-term list of potential acquisition targets that it evaluates regularly, said keith block, vice chairman, president and chief operating officer in an oct. 3 interview with the wall street journal. occasionally, though, the company finds a unique opportunity where salesforce will see a fit but others may not, he said.      "marc has a track record of pretty good success and he has a vision that sometimes other people don't see," he said. 
     newspaper company gannett co. has dropped its bid to buy chicago tribune and los angeles times publisher tronc inc., ending a monthslong pursuit of its rival.      in a one-line statement tuesday, gannett said it had been engaged in discussions with tronc but determined not to pursue the transaction any longer.      gannett's stock rose 9.4% to $8.50 premarket as tronc fell 29% to $8.51, well below gannett's initial takeover offer of $12.25 a share in cash, which had since been boosted.      the news that a deal is off comes after the wall street journal reported in august that gannett had privately sweetened its bid for tronc, which in may rejected a boosted $15 a share offer. gannett first made a bid for tronc in april, when it was then called tribune publishing.      a transaction would have been the latest amid a flurry of newspaper deals. gannett has been seeking to build scale in a newspaper industry suffering from steep declines in advertising revenue. a combined company would have joined titles such as gannett's usa today with the chicago tribune and los angeles times.
valeant pharmaceuticals international inc.'s talks to sell a stomach-drug business to japan's takeda pharmaceutical co. for roughly $10 billion have broken down amid last-minute disagreements over price and other matters, according to people familiar with the matter.      though the talks could still be revived, valeant is now focused on building the business, salix pharmaceuticals, rather than selling it, the people said.      the development represents another setback for a company that's been plagued by an accounting scandal, the departure of its top executives and a plummeting share price. as of tuesday's close, valeant shares had fallen 80% in the past year.      valeant is now moving ahead with plans to build the sales force for salix's crown jewel, the xifaxan irritable-bowel drug. valeant announced the "significant" expansion in a news release tuesday.
increases focus on photonic integration solutions for high speed 100g and beyond networks  company updates business outlook for fourth quarter of 2016   neophotonics (nyse: nptn) (‚Äúneophotonics‚Äù or the ‚Äúcompany‚Äù), a leading designer and manufacturer of advanced hybrid photonic integrated optoelectronic modules and subsystems for bandwidth-intensive, high-speed communications networks, today announced that it executed a definitive agreement, to sell its access and low speed transceiver product lines (the ‚Äúlow speed business‚Äù) to apat optoelectronics components co., ltd. (‚Äúapat oe‚Äù) of shenzhen, china, a designer and manufacturer of optical sub-assemblies for telecom and datacom markets.   the assets to be sold include the intellectual property, inventory and fixed assets for neophotonics‚Äô pon products including gpon and gepon transceiver products at up to 10g data rates, plus 10g and below telecom, bidirectional and specialty transceiver products.   the transaction is valued at approximately $26.4 million, inclusive of post-closing payments under a transition services agreement. the transaction value consists of an equivalent of $25.0 million purchase price plus an additional equivalent of $1.4 million to be paid as certain transition services are delivered. the consideration consists of not less than the equivalent of $23.0 million to be paid in cash in china renminbi at close and not more than $2.0 million in a us dollar denominated promissory note. in addition, the purchaser will assume outstanding supply chain purchase commitments and will be responsible for payment of value-added tax obligations. the purchase price is subject to austment after closing for inventory austments and by up to $10 million in the event of potential claims under transaction warranty commitments of neophotonics. the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in january 2017. the purchaser is further subject to a $1.0 million breakup fee to be held in escrow, which will be applied to the purchase price upon closing or forfeited if the transaction does not close due to certain reasons attributable to the purchaser.   the secured promissory note of up to $2.0 million is for an initial term of six months with an initial interest rate of 6.0% per annum. the note is renewable at six month intervals with an increase in the interest rate by an additional 4% per annum. the note will be secured by inventory and certain fixed assets being purchased in the transaction.   in 2015, and for the first 9 months of 2016, the low speed business generated $92.8 million and $50.7 million in revenue, respectively, and gross profit of $16.7 million and $9.7 million, respectively. net assets for the business were approximately $18.0 million as of september 30, 2016.   commenting on the transaction, tim jenks, neophotonics chief executive officer, stated, ‚Äúafter a comprehensive evaluation of the alternatives available for the low speed business, we believe this transaction will best benefit our shareholders, customers, and employees. this transaction underscores our objective to focus our efforts on growing high speed optical networking products and solutions based on our advanced hybrid photonic integration technology platform to meet customer demand.‚Äù jenks continued, ‚Äúwe believe the low speed business will benefit from apat oe's expertise in access and pon products while continuing to provide quality products, support and services to customers.‚Äù   ‚Äúwe are excited to have the neophotonics low speed product team join apat, and look forward to having more products to sell to our largest customers as well as the opportunity this transaction creates for us to gain many new customers,‚Äù commented rex gu, founder and ceo of apat oe.   raymond james & associates, inc. served as the exclusive financial advisor to neophotonics for the transaction. proskauer, rose served as legal counsel to neophotonics.   updated outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016   neophotonics also announced an updated outlook for the fourth quarter ending december 31, 2016, given recent developments. demand in the fourth quarter continues to exceed the company‚Äôs capacity to supply high speed products while production capacities continue to increase. as new capacity has been brought on line, production yields at one of its fab facilities have been lower than anticipated, resulting in delayed shipments and higher manufacturing costs during the quarter versus previous projections.   taking this factor into account, the company now expects its fourth quarter outlook to be as follows:            gaap        non-gaap   4q‚Äô16 revenue        $105 million to $109 million   gross margin        27% to 30%        28% to 31%   operating expenses        $30 to $32 million        $27 to $29 million   earnings per share        $(0.08) to $0.00        $0.03 to $0.11    the non-gaap outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016 excludes the impact of expected amortization of intangibles of approximately $1.1 million and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation of approximately $4.4 million, of which $1.4 million is estimated for cost of goods sold, which are unchanged from previous projections.   in the company‚Äôs previously communicated outlook view, the company anticipated that the low speed business would produce revenues of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and range from $40 to $45 million in revenue in 2017. the comparable annual revenue for the low speed business in 2016 is expected to be approximately $61 million. upon divesting the low speed business, the company‚Äôs revenue growth rate for the continuing business is expected to be higher as a result. the company‚Äôs business is seasonal on an annual cycle; the company‚Äôs normalized first quarter revenue over the last several years has typically been 20 to 22% of the year in the first quarter, and then increasing throughout the remainder of the year.   non-gaap and austed ebitda measures vs. gaap financial measures   the company‚Äôs non-gaap measures exclude certain gaap financial measures. these non-gaap financial measures differ from gaap measures with the same captions and may differ from non-gaap financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies. as such, these non-gaap measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap. the company uses these non-gaap financial measures to analyze its operating performance and future prospects, develop internal budgets and financial goals, and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. neophotonics believes that these non-gaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of its operations that, when viewed with its gaap results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business.   conference call   the company will host a conference call today, december 19, 2016, at 5:00 p.m. eastern standard time (2:00 p.m. pacific standard time). president and chief executive officer, tim jenks, and chief financial officer, ray wallin, will discuss the transaction and
