by liz hoffman and jonathan d. rockoff    jazz pharmaceuticals plc (jazz) is nearing a deal to buy celator pharmaceuticals inc. (cpxx) for about $1.5 billion, a huge premium for a company with a promising leukemia drug but no revenue.   the deal could be announced as soon as tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter.   jazz would be shelling out roughly double celator's market value of about $740 million--a lofty premium even in biotechnology, where acquirers often pay up for promising new treatments. less than three months ago, celator announced positive results for a clinical trial of a leukemia drug.   the therapy, vyxeos, aims to treat a blood cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia with two currently available drugs in a new formulation.   in mid-march, celator, of ewing, n.j., released data indicating the drug candidate prolonged the lives of patients. the news raised investors' confidence that the compound would be approved, and celator's share price rose more than 400% in a single day.   celator subsequently sold new shares to raise money that it could use to bring vyxeos to market, if it is approved. but some analysts still questioned whether the company, which doesn't have any revenue, would have enough money to do that.   jazz has a market value of about $9 billion and had nearly $1 billon in cash as of march 31. the company is headquartered in california but has a foreign tax address, thanks to its 2012 acquisition of an israeli drug company--a so-called tax inversion that moved its legal home to ireland.   such deals have been popular among drug companies, and many that struck them around that time have since become voracious acquirers in the us   however, jazz largely sat out the wave of consolidation in specialty pharmaceuticals over the past two years. its last major purchase was a 2014 deal for gentium spa, an italian maker of drugs to treat rare diseases. jazz spent about $1 billion to acquire gentium.   but wall street has questioned what the company will do when its main product, narcolepsy drug xyrem, loses patent protection. executives have indicated they are interested in bulking up the company's portfolio of cancer treatments, such as the one celator is developing.   jazz already sells two drugs for cancer patients. one is erwinaze, a treatment for a blood cancer known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. jazz recently began selling a new drug in the us, defitelio, which treats a rare but fatal complication of stem-cell transplants given to certain cancer patients.   jazz shares are down about 15% over the past year, though they have recovered somewhat from the broad selloff in pharmaceutical stocks last summer. the company posted $1.3 billion in revenue last year, a 13% increase over 2014.   there's been a steady stream of deal making in biotech even as merger activity amid big drug makers has slowed somewhat this year. two weeks ago, pfizer inc. (pfe) struck a $4.5 billion deal to buy anacor pharmaceuticals inc. (anac), which is currently seeking approval from the food and drug administration for an eczema treatment.    write to liz hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com and jonathan d. rockoff at jonathan.rockoff@wsj.com

by david benoit and jonathan d. rockoff      valeant pharmaceuticals international inc. is in advanced talks to sell a big stomach-drug business to japan's takeda pharmaceutical co. for about $10 billion, a move that could ease pressure on valeant over its hefty debt load.      the companies could reach a deal for salix pharmaceuticals ltd., which valeant bought just a year-and-a-half ago, in the coming weeks, people familiar with the matter said. the purchase price would include about $8.5 billion in cash and future royalty payments to valeant, the people said. there is no guarantee the companies will reach a deal and, indeed, there is another unnamed potential bidder in the mix, according to a person familiar with the matter.      should valeant strike a deal, it would allow the company to largely pay back its bank lenders, removing a big area of concern for investors ever since the drugmaker became embroiled in an accounting scandal last year. valeant has told investors it would work to reduce its debt load, but the company was expected to do so through a series of smaller steps.      it would also likely allow valeant's new chief executive, joseph papa, to focus on rebuilding valeant's core franchises in skin and eye drugs, which include bausch & lomb brands, have been struggling.      salix makes treatments for stomach disorders like traveler's diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome, or ibs.      for takeda, the purchase would come after it lost out on earlier attempts to buy salix and deliver big-selling gastrointestinal drugs it has been seeking to bolster its lineup of stomach remedies.      --dana mattioli contributed to this article.   write to david benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com and jonathan d. rockoff at jonathan.rockoff@wsj.com

    walt disney co. on monday emerged as another potential bidder for twitter inc., the struggling social-media service, people familiar with the matter said.      twitter, with a stock-market value of nearly $20 billion, has also held preliminary talks with salesforce.com inc., according to people familiar with the matter.      the sale process is in early stages and it is far from guaranteed that anyone will end up buying twitter.      the takeover talks have been fueled by twitter's sluggish growth in users and revenue, perennial turnover among senior executives and a lack of mission and business plan as focused as those of competitors like facebook inc.      twitter shares rose 3.3% to $23.37 on monday, after rising 21% on friday when news of salesforce's interest emerged. disney stock fell 1.4% to $91.96 a share on monday.      a twitter acquisition would be disney's biggest technology deal yet, following recent investments in hulu and vice, among others.      recent moves by twitter into streaming sports events online have attracted the attention of disney chief executive robert iger. in august, the burbank, calif.,-based media giant said it was spending $1 billion for a 33% stake in bamtech, a streaming-media company created by major league baseball that twitter is using to live stream sporting events.      since disney owns espn, the media giant could view twitter's sports-programming efforts as creating a potential rival -- or, in the event of a successful acquisition, it could be a source of technology that could benefit espn as cord-cutting becomes more widespread.      mr. iger offered a positive assessment of the bamtech-twitter partnership in a question-and-answer session at an investor conference held by goldman sachs earlier this month.      "i thought twitter actually did a very good job," he said, referring to one of the national football league games that the site had hosted. "that platform was powered by bamtech last week and will be, which i think says a lot about that platform because it was very stable."      disney's investment in bamtech, which could eventually expand to a majority stake, was seen by wall street as an olive branch after investor concerns about slowing subscriber growth at the company's espn cable channel.      mr. iger described twitter at the goldman sachs conference as a "new entrant" in the arena of sports rights but also defended his own subsidiary. "you have to think about monetization capabilities of these new entrants," he said. "nobody can monetize sports better than espn," he said.      twitter and disney also have ties through twitter ceo jack dorsey, who has served on the media company's board since 2013. he has looked to mr. iger as a mentor, especially as mr. dorsey has had to wade through the diverse demands of the two companies he co-founded and runs: twitter and payment company square. in an interview last year, mr. iger told the wall street journal he occasionally counsels the younger ceo on business matters. "i am not involved in his businesses, so i am a good sounding board for him," mr. iger said.      disney's potential interest in twitter was reported earlier by bloomberg.       disney has a mixed record when it comes to acquiring technology companies -- all of which have been much smaller than twitter.      in 2014, it paid an initial $500 million for maker studios, an online video producer popular among younger viewers finding their entertainment on youtube inc. an additional $450 million was promised if maker met certain performance targets, but disney ended up paying only $175 million, according to filings with the securities and exchange commission.      maker's ceo, ynon kreiz, left the company last year, and several other high-ranking executives have departed since the disney acquisition. maker announced it was laying off an unspecified number of workers earlier this year.      not all disney's tech acquisitions have been well-timed. disney bought the social-gaming company playdom inc. for $563 million in 2010, not long before social games plummeted in popularity.      disney interactive, the company's videogame and online-content division, merged with disney consumer products in 2015 following years of losses and layoffs.      it turned a corner to profitability following layoffs that eliminated a quarter of its staff in 2014 and the launch of the "disney infinity" videogame. but in may, disney announced it was booking a $147 million charge and canceling the "infinity" line, a move that cut between 250 and 300 jobs and closed a studio in utah. 
salesforce.com inc. is considering a takeover of twitter inc., according to people familiar with the matter, as the social-media company's efforts to ignite growth sputter.      the exploration is in early stages, one of the people said, and might not lead to a deal. it's unclear who else might be circling twitter, which had a market value of about $13 billion as of thursday's close.      shares of twitter rose 20% to $22.44 friday morning after cnbc reported on a possible sale. before friday, the stock had fallen 30% over the past year.      salesforce shares fell 3.4% to $72.02. a tweet from the account of salesforce's digital chief, vala afshar, seemed to explain the company's interest, "why @twitter? 1 personal learning network 2 the best realtime, context rich news 3 democratize intelligence 4 great place to promote others." a later tweet said mr afshar's views were personal.      twitter's struggles, alongside a deal-friendly climate in silicon valley, have raised questions around twitter's future as an independent public company      in the years since its november 2013 initial public offering, which was priced at $26, twitter has grappled with slow user expansion and shrinking revenue growth. in its june quarter, twitter reported 20% revenue growth, its smallest gain to-date and eighth-straight period of declining growth.      since chief executive jack dorsey retook the helm in 2015, twitter has sought to reinvigorate its ads business around video and revive user growth by making the short-messaging service he invented easier to use.      last october, the company released its moments feature, which curates tweets, photos and videos shared on the service around sporting events, entertainment and breaking news, to help newcomers get pulled into the service.      last week, twitter introduced its first live-stream of a national football league game, with an average audience of 243,000 viewers a minute watching the new york jets beat the buffalo bills. still, that paled in comparison with the average of 15.4 million people who watched the game on cbs and the nfl network.      the football game was one of the first major events for twitter's live-streaming strategy, the cornerstone of its plan to become the premier destination for live events. twitter is trying to appeal to advertisers by capitalizing on its strength as a real-time service and the growing trend of cord-cutting viewers. twitter plans to also stream the presidential and vice presidential debates. 
     softbank group corp. chairman and chief executive masayoshi son said tuesday he would invest $50 billion in the us and create 50,000 new jobs, following a 45-minute private meeting with president elect donald trump.      the japanese billionaire, whose conglomerate controls sprint corp., announced his investment plans in the lobby of trump tower, though he didn't provide details. mr. trump took credit for the investment, saying his november victory spurred softbank's decision.      in an interview, mr. son said the money will be coming from a $100 billion investment fund that he is setting up with saudi arabia's sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners.      softbank has made investments in the us in the past, including paying $22 billion for about 80% of sprint in 2013. last year, softbank also led a $1 billion investment round in san francisco-based online lender social finance inc.      mr. son's initial plan was to merge sprint with t-mobile us inc. to take on market leaders at&t inc. and verizon communications inc., but he abandoned the effort after regulators signaled they would reject the plan. some investors and analysts have said he could make another attempt after the election and when a new chairman is appointed to the federal communications commission.      on tuesday, mr. son declined to comment about his current interest in t-mobile. mr. son said he had set up the meeting with mr. trump and that he likes him "very much."      mr. son, 59, is known as an ambitious investor and has a long history of betting on tech and telecom ventures. most recently, softbank bought u.k. chip designer arm holdings plc for $32 billion.      mr. son also has a history of going straight to national leaders to talk business. in september he met south korean president park geun-hye and said he intends to invest around five trillion won ($4.5 billion) in the country's technology sector. he has also met indian prime minister narendra modi and pledged to spend billions on the nation's tech startups and renewable energy projects.      with the new $100 billion fund -- dubbed the softbank vision fund -- mr. son plans to spend heavily in fields including the so-called internet of things, artificial intelligence, deep learning and robotics. he has said he wants to become the warren buffett of the tech industry.      softbank plans to invest at least $25 billion over the next five years in the fund, while saudi arabia's public investment fund may contribute an additional $45 billion over the same period as the fund's lead partner. 
sanchez energy corp. is in talks to partner with blackstone group lp on a deal for anadarko petroleum corp.'s south texas oil-and-gas assets, according to people familiar with the matter.      while the exact contours of the deal aren't yet clear, blackstone and the private-equity firm's credit arm, gso capital partners, would likely fund or participate in the purchase, the people said. the deal is expected to value the anadarko assets at between $3 billion and $3.5 billion, they added.      a deal could be announced in the next few weeks, the people said.      as always, the talks could fall apart. in recent weeks, sanchez had also been in talks with apollo global management llc and energy-focused private-equity firm eig global energy partners to participate in the bid, some of the people said. while blackstone and gso are currently sanchez's preferred partners, other backers could supplant them if the alliance were to break down, one of the people said.

shire expects to generate additional revenue synergies and a combined non-gaap effective tax rate of 16-17% by 2017. growth is expected to be accelerated by combining capabilities and establishing a global infrastructure that will include a "best of both" commercial model and a presence in over 100 global markets.  the transaction is expected to be accretive to non-gaap diluted eps in 2017, the first calendar year of ownership, and beyond. the combined company is expected to generate annual operating cash flow of $6.0 billion beginning in 2018, underpinning an attractive roic that will exceed shire's cost of capital in 2020.  shire has conducted additional tax due diligence, and based on this diligence, shire and its tax advisor have concluded that a merger with the proposed cash consideration of $18 per baxalta share will maintain the tax-free status of the baxalta spinoff from baxter.  shire has secured an $18 billion fully underwritten bank facility to finance the combination. the new bank facility has a one year life, with a one-year extension available at shire's option.  shire intends to refinance the bank facility through capital market debt issuances in due course. the financing of the transaction has been structured with the intention of maintaining an investment grade credit rating for the combined entity. shire is committed to de-levering rapidly post-close by deploying free cash flow to repay debt. shire is targeting a net debt to ebitda range of between 2.0x and 3.0x 12-18 months post-closing.  transaction details    under the agreement,

by craig karmin      hospitality company sbe entertainment group has agreed to acquire morgans hotel group co., according to people familiar with the matter, ending a long saga in which the two companies have held on-and-off-again merger talks.      sbe is paying $2.25 a share in cash for the outstanding shares of morgans, which were recently trading on the nasdaq market at around $2.00, though the shares were trading as low as $1.33 last week before jumping on speculation of a takeover.      the deal puts an equity value on the company of about $82 million, these people said. the total enterprise value of the combined company, including assumption of debt, would be about $800 million, say people familiar with these companies' thinking.      private-equity investor ronald burkle's yucaipa cos.,which holds $75 million of preferred equity shares in morgans and warrants for common shares, will receive 25% of common equity in sbe, according to people close to the deal.      sbe chief executive sam nazarian, who founded the company in 2002, will become ceo of the combined company and retain majority control. the los angeles-based company is acquiring all the morgans brands and ownership of the hudson and the delano properties.      morgans owns or operates 13 boutique hotels, including new york's hudson, the mondrian in los angeles and the delano in miami beach. the combined company will own or operate 20 hotels, including properties under the flagship sls brand.       sbe and morgans held extensive merger discussions last year but those talks collapsed in november after mr. burkle and jason kalisman, a morgans board member whose investment firm is the biggest shareholder, clashed over terms of the deal.      write to craig karmin at craig.karmin@wsj.com

 talen energy to be acquired by riverstone   stockholders to receive $14.00 per share in cash   transaction has total enterprise value of approximately $5.2 billion   pr newswire   allentown, pa., june 3, 2016   allentown, pa., june 3, 2016 /prnewswire/ -- talen energy corporation (nyse: tln), a competitive energy and power generation company that owns or controls 16,000 megawatts of capacity in eight states, announced today that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with affiliates of riverstone holdings llc ("riverstone"), a private investment firm.   under terms of the merger agreement, all outstanding shares of talen energy common stock not currently owned by riverstone affiliated entities will be acquired for $14.00 per share in cash. affiliates of riverstone currently own approximately 35 percent of the outstanding shares of talen energy common stock, which were issued in the june 2015 transaction that established talen energy by combining competitive generation assets that had been owned by affiliates of ppl corporation and affiliates of riverstone.   the purchase price represents a 56 percent premium to the closing price of $9.00 per share on march 31, 2016, the last trading day before public reports of a potential sale of talen energy, and a 101 percent premium to the 60-day volume-weighted average price of $6.95 per share through march 31.   the transaction has a total enterprise value of approximately $5.2 billion.   "we believe the transaction offers compelling value to our stockholders, while eliminating execution risk, and will provide additional momentum to the outstanding work our employees have done to drive improvements in the safety, reliability and efficiency of our plants in the time since we became an independent company," said paul farr, talen energy president and chief executive officer.   "the disinterested directors of the board, not including the two riverstone directors, with the assistance of our financial and legal advisors, carefully analyzed riverstone's offer, and after extensive negotiation and thorough consideration, concluded that the agreement we are announcing today is in the best interests of our stockholders," said stuart e. graham, chairman of talen energy's board of directors.   david m. leuschen and pierre f. lapeyre, jr., co-founders of riverstone, added, "as an experienced owner of power generation assets, riverstone is excited to acquire talen energy and its world class generating fleet, which is located in some of the united states' most attractive power markets."   'go shop'   the agreement provides for a "go-shop" period, during which talen energy -- with the assistance of its legal and financial advisors -- may actively solicit, receive, evaluate and potentially enter into negotiations with parties that offer alternative proposals. the go-shop period is 40 days. talen energy will be permitted to continue discussions with certain parties that make a qualifying offer during the go-shop period for an additional 20 days and, subject to customary requirements included in the agreement, enter into or recommend a transaction with a person or group that makes a superior proposal. the agreement provides for the payment of a termination fee by talen energy to riverstone in the event that the agreement is terminated for a superior proposal, which termination fee will be $50 million, but which will be reduced to $25 million if talen energy accepts a superior proposal made during the go-shop period.   there can be no assurance that this process will result in a superior proposal. talen energy does not intend to disclose developments during this process unless and until the board makes a decision with respect to any superior proposal it may receive.   stockholder and regulatory approval   in addition to approval by stockholders representing a majority of outstanding shares of common stock, the transaction is subject to approval by a majority of non- riverstone affiliated stockholders voting at a special stockholder meeting to be scheduled. riverstone and its affiliates have agreed to vote their 35 percent stake in favor of the proposed transaction.   the transaction is subject to expiration of the applicable waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act, approval of the nuclear regulatory commission and the federal energy regulatory commission, as well as certain other customary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. riverstone's obligation to consummate the transaction is also subject to talen energy having a minimum amount of cash and revolving credit facility capacity available at closing.   the parties currently expect the transaction to be completed by the end of 2016.   transaction financing   the consideration for the common stock in the transaction, of approximately $1.8 billion, is expected to be funded by a conversion of riverstone's existing ownership of 35 percent of the common stock of talen into shares of the surviving corporation, talen energy's cash on hand, and proceeds of a $250 million new secured term loan.  the new secured term loan is fully committed by goldman sachs bank usa, royal bank of canada, barclays bank plc, credit suisse ag and credit suisse securities (usa) llc, deutsche bank securities inc. and deutsche bank ag new york branch, morgan stanley senior funding inc., and the bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj ltd., and will rank pari-passu with the existing first lien revolving credit facility of talen energy supply llc (a wholly owned subsidiary of talen energy) ("energy supply"), which will be reduced from $1.85 billion to $1.4 billion upon closing of the transaction. concurrently with the signing of the merger agreement, all of energy supply's subsidiaries that currently guarantee its revolving credit facility have executed guarantees (effective as of the closing of the transaction) of talen energy's outstanding unsecured notes due 2025 ("2025 notes") and its pennsylvania economic development financing authority revenue bonds ("municipal bonds"), which together comprise approximately $831 million of energy supply's approximately $3.3 billion total unsecured debt that will remain outstanding. as a result of this new credit support for the 2025 notes and the municipal bonds, it is expected that these notes and bonds will be structurally senior to the non-guaranteed unsecured debt of energy supply, and we believe that the issue ratings on the 2025 notes and the municipal bonds will be maintained or improved.   financial and legal advisors   citi is serving as financial advisor to talen energy. kirkland & ellis llp is serving as talen energy's legal advisor. goldman, sachs & co. and rbc capital markets are serving as financial advisors to riverstone. wachtell, lipton, rosen & katz and vinson & elkins llp are serving as riverstone's legal advisors for the transaction.   about talen energy   talen energy is one of the largest competitive energy and power generation companies in north america. the company owns or controls 16,000 megawatts of generating capacity in well-developed, structured wholesale power markets, principally in the northeast, mid-atlantic and

will create a national platform with a highly differentiated suite of solutions. it will significantly increase our ability to empower physicians and expand our client relationships. within a highly fragmented marketplace, we will have the critical first mover advantage to capitalize on the greenfield and cross-selling opportunities across our various offerings, and generate significant value for our shareholders.”  compelling strategic and financial rationale  compelling client proposition with differentiated service offerings: the combined organization will have complementary strengths as a physician-led, patient-focused healthcare services organization with a broad national footprint. the company’s platform of differentiated service offerings will span from pre-hospital, acute and outpatient care to post-acute care. well positioned for evolving healthcare environment: as a leader in each of its sub-specialties, the combined organization will be able to use its expansive network to improve patient outcomes and experiences while creating efficiencies through more effective care coordination. strong financial profile: the combined company will have a strong balance sheet with anticipated net debt to austed ebitda at closing of 4.2x, including estimated contributions from recent acquisitions and estimated synergies. the company will have a diversified business mix across verticals, geographies and clients, as well as significant cash-flow generation expected to be deployed for acquisitions, further driving growth while also reducing net leverage. meaningful synergy opportunities: the combination is expected to result in $100 million of synergies, anticipated to be fully realized within three years of closing. synergies are expected to be derived through cost savings as well as meaningful revenue synergies from an enhanced portfolio and cross-selling opportunities. experienced, accomplished management team: the management team has a proven track record of building organizations for the changing healthcare environment and growth through both acquisitions and sales. significant accretion: the transaction is expected to be accretive to the two companies’ combined austed earnings per share in 2017 and double-digit accretive in 2018. additional transaction details  jpmorgan chase bank and barclays have provided

toms river, n.j. and ocean city, n.j., july 13, 2016 (globe newswire) -- oceanfirst financial corp. (“oceanfirst”) (nasdaq:ocfc), headquartered in toms river, new jersey, and ocean shore holding co. (“ocean shore”) (nasdaq:oshc), headquartered in ocean city, new jersey, jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which ocean shore, the holding company and parent of ocean city home bank, will merge with and into oceanfirst, the holding company and parent of oceanfirst bank. ocean city home bank will also merge with and into oceanfirst bank. the transaction is valued at approximately $22.47 per ocean shore common share or approximately $145.6 million in the aggregate.   ocean shore logo.jpg         with roots dating back to 1887, ocean city home bank is one of southern new jersey’s oldest and largest community banks with approximately $1.1 billion in total assets, $818 million in total deposits and $796 million in gross loans. ocean shore operates 11 full-service banking centers in atlantic and cape may counties. following oceanfirst’s recently completed acquisition of cape bancorp, inc., the proposed transaction will further enrich oceanfirst’s distribution, scale and core deposit funding base, as it presents an exceptionally rare opportunity to combine two well-established, like-minded new jersey franchises.  oceanfirst will strengthen its position as the largest bank headquartered in central and southern new jersey and rank as the fourth largest new jersey based banking institution by deposit market share.  based on financial information as of march 31, 2016, and pro forma for the cape transaction, the combined institution would have approximately $5.3 billion in total assets, $4.0 billion in total deposits, $4.0 billion in gross loans and 61 full-service banking locations.  under the terms of the merger agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, upon completion of the merger, shareholders of ocean shore common stock will be entitled to receive $4.35 in cash and 0.9667 shares of oceanfirst common stock for each share of ocean shore common stock. the transaction is expected to close late fourth quarter of 2016 or early first quarter of 2017, subject to each company receiving the required approval of its shareholders, receipt of all required regulatory approvals and fulfillment of other customary closing conditions.  the purchase price equates to 132% of ocean shore’s march 31, 2016 tangible book value, 4.9% premium to core deposits, 20.1x ocean shore’s trailing twelve month earnings, and 9.3x ocean shore’s estimated 2017 (forward) earnings (assuming fully phased-in cost savings). tangible book value per common share is expected to be diluted by approximately 3.1% at closing with a projected earnback period of approximately 3.7 years using the cross-over1 method.  the transaction includes strong earnings per share accretion of approximately 5.4% in 2018 (the first full year of combined operations and synergies) in addition to the projected double-digit earnings accretion from the cape bancorp, inc. transaction. the combined company will be structured to support enhanced financial return targets of greater than 1.05% return on average assets and greater than 13.0% return on average tangible common equity along with remaining “well-capitalized” under regulatory guidelines.  oceanfirst expects to incur pre-tax merger and integration costs of approximately $19 million and to achieve cost savings of approximately 53% of ocean shore’s non-interest expenses or $12.4 million if 2017 cost savings were to be fully phased in.   “we are excited to welcome ocean city home bank customers and employees to the oceanfirst family. our two institutions have developed our respective community banks with a consistent vision, effectively sharing similar histories.  with our mutual understanding of our community bank business models and local market focus, oceanfirst and ocean shore can leverage this synergy to create one of the most highly valued banking institutions in the mid-atlantic region,” said christopher d. maher, president and chief executive officer of oceanfirst.  mr. maher further commented, “this transaction represents a unique opportunity for oceanfirst to capitalize on its recent entry into southern new jersey through the acquisition of an extremely valuable deposit franchise coupled with significant efficiencies and low execution risk. ocean shore’s residential focus creates strategic optionality for prudent commercial real estate growth with strong cash flows.  we look forward to continuing to provide extraordinary customer care to all oceanfirst and ocean shore customers, as well as providing enhanced value to our stockholders.”  steven e. brady, president and chief executive officer of ocean shore, echoed mr. maher’s comments stating, “the combination with oceanfirst provides several strategic benefits for all ocean shore stakeholders, including improved operating scale, access to additional product lines and increased shareholder liquidity.”  mr. brady added that “while this merger solidifies the pro forma bank’s jersey shore dominance, it also provides ocean shore the opportunity to capitalize on oceanfirst’s considerable expansion efforts toward the demographically attractive philadelphia metro market - a natural market extension for ocean shore’s franchise as well.”  to provide for additional representation for oceanfirst’s southern new jersey market area, upon completion of the transaction, three current ocean shore board members are expected to join the oceanfirst board, including mr. brady.  mr. brady will also be named vice chairman for the southern new jersey division, to serve in an advisory capacity for oceanfirst, where he will provide insight from his extensive banking and professional experience.   piper jaffray & co. is serving as financial advisor to oceanfirst and rendered a fairness opinion to oceanfirst’s board of directors in connection with the transaction. skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom llp is serving as legal counsel to oceanfirst. sandler o’neill + partners, l.p. is serving as financial advisor to ocean shore and rendered a fairness

number of exxonmobil shares paid per share of interoil will be calculated based on the volume weighted average price (vwap) of exxonmobil shares over a measuring period of 10 days ending shortly

give exxonmobil access to interoil’s resource base, which includes interests in six licenses in papua new guinea covering about four million acres, including prl 15. the elk-antelope field in prl 15 is the anchor field for the proposed papua lng project.  exxonmobil’s more than 40 years of experience in the global lng business enables it to efficiently link complex elements such as resource development, pipelines, liquefaction plants, shipping and regasification terminals, which it has demonstrated through the png lng project, working closely with co-venturers, national, provincial and local governments, and local communities. exxonmobil will bring to bear its industry-leading performance and strong commitment to excellence as it grows its business in papua new guinea.  the png lng project, the first of its kind in the country, was developed by exxonmobil in challenging conditions on budget and ahead of schedule and is now exceeding production design capacity, demonstrating the company’s leadership in project management and operations.  exxonmobil will work with co-venturers and the government to evaluate processing of gas from the elk-antelope field by expanding the png lng project. this would take advantage of synergies offered by expansion of an existing project to realize time and cost reductions that would benefit the png treasury, the government’s holding in oil search, other shareholders and landowners.  path to completion  the exxonmobil transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies. the interoil board unanimously recommends that interoil shareholders approve the exxonmobil transaction.  the exxonmobil transaction will be implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the business corporations act (yukon) and will require the approval of at least 66 2/3 percent of the votes cast by interoil shareholders at a special meeting expected to take place in september, 2016.  in addition to interoil shareholder and court approvals, the exxonmobil transaction is also subject to other customary conditions. subject to obtaining the aforementioned approvals and satisfaction of closing conditions, the exxonmobil transaction is expected to close in september, 2016.  further information regarding the transaction with exxonmobil will be included in an information circular, which will be mailed to interoil shareholders in due course. copies of the key transaction documents for the exxonmobil transaction (being the arrangement agreement and the information circular) will be available online under interoil’s corporate profile at www.sedar.com.  oil search transaction  the interoil board of directors, in consultation with its independent legal and financial advisors, determined that the exxonmobil transaction is superior to the previously announced transaction with oil search limited (asx:osh, pomsox: osh) and so advised oil search on july 18, 2016. immediately prior to entering into the arrangement agreement with exxonmobil, interoil terminated its previously announced arrangement agreement with oil search, and exxonmobil is paying oil search

transaction, valued at $12.2 billion, creates leading midwest electric utility better positioned to serve customers and meet the region’s energy needs.  great plains energy incorporated (nyse: gxp), the parent company of kcp&l, and westar energy, inc. (nyse: wr), today announced a definitive agreement for great plains energy to acquire westar in a combined cash and stock transaction with an enterprise value of approximately $12.2 billion, including total equity value of approximately $8.6 billion. upon closing, westar will become a wholly owned subsidiary of great plains energy.  once the transaction is complete, great plains energy will have more than 1.5 million customers in kansas and missouri, nearly 13,000 megawatts of generation capacity, almost 10,000 miles of transmission lines and over 51,000 miles of distribution lines. in addition, more than 45 percent of the combined utility’s retail customer demand can be met with emission-free energy.  “westar and kcp&l are trusted neighbors and have worked together for generations in kansas. the combination of our two companies is the best fit for meeting our region’s energy needs,” said terry bassham, chairman and chief executive officer of great plains energy and kcp&l. “this is an important transaction for kansas and our entire region. by combining our two companies, we are keeping ownership local and management responsive to regulators, customers and regional needs, while enhancing our ability to build long-term value for shareholders.”  currently, great plains energy and westar jointly own and operate the wolf creek nuclear generating station, as well as the la cygne and jeffrey power plants. with the addition of westar’s generation fleet, great plains energy will have a more diverse and sustainable generation portfolio. this will provide increased flexibility to mitigate the potential customer impacts from future carbon regulation. in addition, among investor-owned utilities in the united states, the combined company will have one of the largest portfolios of wind generation in the country.  “this is an important day for westar, our customers, employees, shareholders, the communities we support and for the state of kansas,” said mark ruelle, president and chief executive officer of westar. “our commitment to reliability, customer satisfaction, safety and sustainability is consistent with great plains energy’s values, which makes them our ideal partner. we’re eager to join the great plains energy team, and excited about this new chapter that combines the unique strengths of our respective organizations to form an even stronger company for our state.”  great plains energy has an established track record of successful integration with aacent electric utilities. in 2008, great plains energy completed its acquisition of aquila, an electric utility serving customers in aacent areas of missouri. that successful acquisition has delivered – and continues to deliver – significant savings for customers, which exceeded initial expectations and was reviewed and approved by both the missouri public service commission and the kansas corporation commission.  “the utility industry is facing rising customer expectations, increasing environmental standards and emerging cyber security threats. these factors, coupled with slower demand growth for electricity, are driving our costs and customer rates higher. our acquisition of westar will create operational efficiencies and future cost savings that will benefit all involved – customers, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve. these savings also will help reduce future rate increase requests,” said bassham. “combining our two companies will result in cost savings and operational benefits for our more than 900,000 kansas and 600,000 missouri customers.”  transaction terms and financing profile  under the terms of the agreement, which was unanimously approved by the boards of directors for both companies, westar shareholders will receive $60.00 per share of total consideration for each share of westar common stock, consisting of $51.00 in cash and $9.00 in great plains energy common stock, subject to a 7.5 percent collar based upon the great plains energy common stock price at the time of the closing of the transaction, with the exchange ratio for the stock consideration ranging between 0.2709 to 0.3148 shares of

     salesforce.com inc. said it won't pursue a bid for twitter inc., ending weeks of speculation and sending shares of the social-media company down 6.4%.      salesforce chief executive marc benioff in recent weeks had signaled his interest in twitter to investors. at a company conference last week, he called twitter an " unpolished jewel."      but salesforce investors reacted negatively to the idea, sending salesforce shares down almost 6% on oct. 5.      the stock move, and other feedback from investors, seemed to trigger second thoughts at salesforce about the wisdom of a bid.      the financial times reported earlier friday that salesforce was no longer interested in twitter. "it wasn't the right fit for us," the paper quoted mr. benioff as saying.      a salesforce spokeswoman confirmed that the company wouldn't make a bid for twitter. salesforce shares rose 6.2% following the news.      a twitter spokeswoman declined to comment.      salesforce.com maintains a long-term list of potential acquisition targets that it evaluates regularly, said keith block, vice chairman, president and chief operating officer in an oct. 3 interview with the wall street journal. occasionally, though, the company finds a unique opportunity where salesforce will see a fit but others may not, he said.      "marc has a track record of pretty good success and he has a vision that sometimes other people don't see," he said. 
     newspaper company gannett co. has dropped its bid to buy chicago tribune and los angeles times publisher tronc inc., ending a monthslong pursuit of its rival.      in a one-line statement tuesday, gannett said it had been engaged in discussions with tronc but determined not to pursue the transaction any longer.      gannett's stock rose 9.4% to $8.50 premarket as tronc fell 29% to $8.51, well below gannett's initial takeover offer of $12.25 a share in cash, which had since been boosted.      the news that a deal is off comes after the wall street journal reported in august that gannett had privately sweetened its bid for tronc, which in may rejected a boosted $15 a share offer. gannett first made a bid for tronc in april, when it was then called tribune publishing.      a transaction would have been the latest amid a flurry of newspaper deals. gannett has been seeking to build scale in a newspaper industry suffering from steep declines in advertising revenue. a combined company would have joined titles such as gannett's usa today with the chicago tribune and los angeles times.
valeant pharmaceuticals international inc.'s talks to sell a stomach-drug business to japan's takeda pharmaceutical co. for roughly $10 billion have broken down amid last-minute disagreements over price and other matters, according to people familiar with the matter.      though the talks could still be revived, valeant is now focused on building the business, salix pharmaceuticals, rather than selling it, the people said.      the development represents another setback for a company that's been plagued by an accounting scandal, the departure of its top executives and a plummeting share price. as of tuesday's close, valeant shares had fallen 80% in the past year.      valeant is now moving ahead with plans to build the sales force for salix's crown jewel, the xifaxan irritable-bowel drug. valeant announced the "significant" expansion in a news release tuesday.

were approximately $18.0 million as of september 30, 2016.   commenting on the transaction, tim jenks, neophotonics chief executive officer, stated, “after a comprehensive evaluation of the alternatives available for the low speed business, we believe this transaction will best benefit our shareholders, customers, and employees. this transaction underscores our objective to focus our efforts on growing high speed optical networking products and solutions based on our advanced hybrid photonic integration technology platform to meet customer demand.” jenks continued, “we believe the low speed business will benefit from apat oe's expertise in access and pon products while continuing to provide quality products, support and services to customers.”   “we are excited to have the neophotonics low speed product team join apat, and look forward to having more products to sell to our largest customers as well as the opportunity this transaction creates for us to gain many new customers,” commented rex gu, founder and ceo of apat oe.   raymond james & associates, inc. served as the exclusive financial advisor to neophotonics for the transaction. proskauer, rose served as legal counsel to neophotonics.   updated outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016   neophotonics also announced an updated outlook for the fourth quarter ending december 31, 2016, given recent developments. demand in the fourth quarter continues to exceed the company’s capacity to supply high speed products while production capacities continue to increase. as new capacity has been brought on line, production yields at one of its fab facilities have been lower than anticipated, resulting in delayed shipments and higher manufacturing costs during the quarter versus previous projections.   taking this factor into account, the company now expects its fourth quarter outlook to be as follows:            gaap        non-gaap   4q’16 revenue        $105 million to $109 million   gross margin        27% to 30%        28% to 31%   operating expenses        $30 to $32 million        $27 to $29 million   earnings per share        $(0.08) to $0.00        $0.03 to $0.11    the non-gaap outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016 excludes the impact of expected amortization of intangibles of approximately $1.1 million and the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation of approximately $4.4 million, of which $1.4 million is estimated for cost of goods sold, which are unchanged from previous projections.   in the company’s previously communicated outlook view, the company anticipated that the low speed business would produce revenues of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and range from $40 to $45 million in revenue in 2017. the comparable annual revenue for the low speed business in 2016 is expected to be approximately $61 million. upon divesting the low speed business, the company’s revenue growth rate for the continuing business is expected to be higher as a result. the company’s business is seasonal on an annual cycle; the company’s normalized first quarter revenue over the last several years has typically been 20 to 22% of the year in the first quarter, and then increasing throughout the remainder of the year.   non-gaap and austed ebitda measures vs. gaap financial measures   the company’s non-gaap measures exclude certain gaap financial measures. these non-gaap financial measures differ from gaap measures with the same captions and may differ from non-gaap financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies. as such, these non-gaap measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap. the company uses these non-gaap financial measures to analyze its operating performance and future prospects, develop internal budgets and financial goals, and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. neophotonics believes that these non-gaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of its operations that, when viewed with its gaap results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business.   conference call   the company will host a conference call today, december 19, 2016, at 5:00 p.m. eastern

"over the last two years, we've been focused on identifying opportunities that would extend and diversify our asset base and sources of growth beyond 2019," said al monaco, president and chief executive officer, enbridge inc. "we are accomplishing that goal by combining with the premier natural gas infrastructure company to create a true north american and global energy infrastructure leader. this transaction is transformational for both companies and results in unmatched scale, diversity and financial flexibility with multiple platforms for organic growth."   greg ebel, president and chief executive officer of spectra energy, who will become chairman of enbridge following the closing of the transaction, said, "the combination of enbridge and spectra energy creates what we believe will be the best, most diversified energy infrastructure company in north america, if not the world. this is an incredible opportunity for both companies and we at spectra energy could not be more excited about what it means going forward. together, the merged company will have what we believe is the finest platform for serving customers in every region of north america and providing investors with the opportunity for superior shareholder returns."   mr. monaco added, "bringing enbridge and spectra energy together makes strong strategic and financial sense, and the all-stock nature of the transaction provides shareholders of both companies with the opportunity to participate in the significant upside potential of the combined company. with combined secured projects in execution of c$26 billion (us$20 billion) and another c$48 billion (us$37 billion) of projects under development, the transaction allows us to extend our anticipated 10-12 percent annual dividend growth through 2024. we believe our combination of best-in-class assets, superior growth and strong commercial underpinning of our business will be unrivaled in our sector. importantly, we will preserve and enhance our shareholder value proposition, which centers on delivering consistent growth with a low-risk business model.   "this is also a combination of two companies, management and staff that have a shared vision and talented teams that are dedicated to serving customers and providing the energy that people want and need, safely and reliably every day. we look forward to welcoming spectra energy employees to enbridge as we move forward as one company. in building on our existing strengths by joining with spectra energy, enbridge will be very well positioned for future growth and continued value creation."  mr. ebel added, "the strength of the combined company will support a large capital program to fund the continued development of spectra energy's existing, preeminent project inventory in addition to allowing the combined company to compete for and win the most attractive new growth projects - all while maintaining expected strong dividend growth with exceptional coverage. the transaction premium recognizes the strength of spectra energy's world-class natural gas pipeline system and significant expansion program, while providing shareholders the opportunity to participate in the unparalleled value creation potential of the combined company. while our assets are largely complementary, our values are shared, and together we will create a best-in-class company for shareholders, employees, customers, and communities alike."  compelling value proposition    --  six leading strategic growth

www.spectraenergy.com.  --  secure, low-risk commercial structure with stable long-term cash flow     visibility: 96 percent of pro-forma free cash flow is underpinned by     long-term commercial agreements (cost-of-service, take-or-pay, of fixed     fee); 93 percent of customers are strong, investment grade or equivalent     counterparties; less than 5 percent of combined pro-forma cash flow will     have direct exposure to commodity price risk.  --  largest and most secure program of diversified organic growth projects     in the industry: together, enbridge and spectra energy bring c$26     billion (us$20 billion) in secured capital and a c$48 billion (us$37     billion) inventory of probability weighted projects in development.  --  strong balance sheet, growing cash flow and access to capital markets to     fund large capital program: the combination is expected to result in     sufficient internally generated cash flow to fund growth and improve     balance sheet strength. enbridge will have multiple, cost-effective     funding sources and be even more competitive in capturing opportunities.  --  attractive dividend yield with visible organic dividend growth: the     combined company's c$74 billion (us$57 billion) organic growth platform     is expected to support a highly visible dividend growth rate of 10-12     percent through 2024, including an anticipated aggregate increase of 15     percent in 2017 post closing, while maintaining a conservative payout of     50-60 percent of available cash flow from operations (acffo). this     provides an industry leading total return driven by a strong, low-risk     dividend yield.  --  achievable cost synergies: the combination is expected to achieve annual     run-rate synergies of c$540 million (us$415 million), the majority of     which should be achieved in the latter part of 2018. in addition,     approximately c$260 million (us$200 million) of tax savings can be     achieved through utilization of tax losses commencing in 2019.  --  complementary businesses, shared culture and values support smooth     integration: enbridge and spectra energy have similar business and     operational models,

"we see tremendous opportunity to better serve our commercial aviation, business jet and military customers through broader offerings."   ortberg continued, "b/e aerospace has a leading position in nearly all the segments it serves and a highly visible, long-cycle backlog. beyond new aircraft deliveries, its $12 billion installed base provides a strong flow of aftermarket retrofit opportunities
