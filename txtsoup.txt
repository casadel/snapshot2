conatus announces exclusive worldwide option, collaboration and license agreement covering development and commercialization of emricasan   - conference call and webcast presentation at 5:30 p.m. et today -   - continuing initial focus on nash cirrhosis with parallel development in nash fibrosis -   - full funding in position for remaining development of emricasan -   san diego, dec. 19, 2016 (globe newswire) -- conatus pharmaceuticals inc. (nasdaq:cnat) today announced it has entered into an exclusive option, collaboration and license agreement for the global development and commercialization of its first-in-class, orally active pan-caspase inhibitor emricasan with novartis. under the terms of the agreement with novartis, conatus will receive $50 million upfront, and is eligible to receive $7 million following the exercise of the license option. conatus can borrow up to $15 million in the form of convertible promissory notes under an investment agreement with novartis.   conatus is eligible to receive significant payments if certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones are met. furthermore, conatus is eligible to receive tiered double digit royalties on emricasan single agent sales and tiered single to double digit royalties on sales of combination products containing emricasan. conatus has the option to co-commercialize emricasan in the united states, including combination therapies, on a cost-sharing and revenue-sharing basis in lieu of us royalties and with reduced ex-us royalties. conatus retains limited rights to develop other pan-caspase inhibitors.   in addition, novartis will pay 50% of conatus' phase2b emricasan development costs after the option exercise, including the planned encore-lf trial in decompensated nash cirrhosis which, under the current development plan consistent with recent regulatory agency recommendations, will be conducted as phase2b rather than phase2b/3. phase2b emricasan development costs also encompass the ongoing encore-ph trial in primarily compensated nash cirrhosis, polt-hcv-svr trial in post-transplant hcv fibrosis and cirrhosis, and encore-nf trial in nash fibrosis. novartis will assume full responsibility for emricasan's phase3 development and all combination product development.   "we believe novartis is ideally suited to collaborate with conatus in the further development of emricasan for chronic liver diseases," said conatus co-founder, president and chief executive officer steven j. mento, ph.d. "this collaboration validates the conatus emphasis on the initial development of emricasan as a single agent treatment for nash cirrhosis in both compensated and decompensated patients, and sets the stage for simultaneous development of oral combination therapies for the treatment of nash fibrosis including emricasan and one of the novartis internal fxr (farnesoid x receptor) agonists in clinical development. their strong commitment to and expertise in liver disease, and proven record of success in drug development provide our best opportunity to deliver these potentially groundbreaking new therapies to chronic liver disease patients with high unmet medical need."   "for conatus, the near-term infusion of capital and phase2b cost-sharing allows us to fund ongoing operations through 2019. in addition, with the novartis commitment to fund phase3 single agent emricasan development and all combination development activities, the resources are in place to complete emricasan development both as a single agent for nash cirrhosis and as a single agent or part of a combination therapy for nash fibrosis," added dr. mento. "the option to co-commercialize in the united states preserves future flexibility for conatus, and the ability to continue pursuing independent development of other compounds affords us the opportunity to build a portfolio of potential products to drive further long-term value for our shareholders."   conference call/webcast/presentation   conatus will host a conference call and webcast at 5:30 p.m. eastern time today, monday, december 19, to discuss the collaboration and license agreement and update the emricasan development program. to access the conference call, please dial 877-312-5857 (domestic) or 970-315-0455 (international) at least five minutes prior to the start time and refer to conference id 38755660. an associated presentation and live and archived webcast of the call will be available in the investors section of the company's website at www.conatuspharma.com.   about emricasan clinical development   to date, emricasan has been studied in over 650 subjects in sixteen clinical trials across a broad range of liver disease etiologies and stages of progression. in multiple clinical trials, emricasan has demonstrated statistically significant, rapid and sustained reductions in elevated levels of key biomarkers of inflammation and apoptosis that are implicated in the severity and progression of liver disease. recent emricasan clinical trial results have demonstrated emricasan's ability to provide statistically significant improvements in clinically important validated surrogate endpoints of portal hypertension and liver function across a variety of etiologies in the subgroups of liver cirrhosis patients with highest medical need. the parallel emricasan, a caspase inhibitor, for evaluation (encore) clinical trials are designed to provide clinically relevant efficacy, dosing, and safety data from chronic administration in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) cirrhosis and fibrosis to support the design of phase3 efficacy and safety trials in these indications.   the company is evaluating emricasan's potential effects on clinically relevant consequences of nash cirrhosis in its ongoing phase2b encore-ph (for portal hypertension) clinical trial with an hvpg portal hypertension surrogate endpoint, initiated in november 2016, in patients with compensated or early decompensated liver cirrhosis caused by nash, and with severe portal hypertension. the company is evaluating emricasan's potential longer-term effects on liver structure in its ongoing phase2b encore-nf (for nash fibrosis) clinical trial with a histology-based endpoint, initiated in january 2016, in patients with nash fibrosis and its ongoing phase2b polt-hcv-svr clinical trial with a histology-based endpoint, initiated in may 2014, in post-orthotopic liver transplant (polt) recipients who have reestablished liver fibrosis or cirrhosis post-transplant as a result of recurrent hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection and who have successfully achieved a sustained viral response (svr) following antiviral therapy. the planned phase2b encore-lf (for liver function) clinical trial with a composite clinical endpoint, expected to begin in the first half of 2017, will evaluate the effects of emricasan on liver function and collect chronic administration safety information in decompensated nash cirrhosis patients. conatus expects topline results from its ongoing and planned clinical trials to be available periodically beginning in the first half of 2018.   about conatus pharmaceuticals   conatus is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of novel medicines to treat liver disease. conatus is developing its lead compound, emricasan, for the treatment of patients with chronic liver disease. emricasan is designed to reduce the activity of enzymes that mediate inflammation and apoptosis. conatus believes that by reducing the activity of these enzymes, emricasan has the potential to interrupt the disease progression across the spectrum of liver disease. for additional information, please visit www.conatuspharma.com.
study to evaluate potential of cb-839 plus opdivo to target immune-suppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment  bristol-myers squibb company (nyse:bmy) and calithera biosciences, inc. (nasdaq:cala), a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule drugs directed against tumor metabolism and tumor immunology targets for the treatment of cancer, today announced a clinical trial collaboration to evaluate bristol-myers squibb’s opdivo in combination with calithera’s cb-839 in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccrcc). cb-839 is an orally administered glutaminase inhibitor currently in phase1/2 clinical studies.   preclinical data suggest that cb-839, which is designed to target a pathway to starve tumor cells of the key nutrient glutamine, may enhance the effects of checkpoint inhibitors and may also reverse tumor resistance to checkpoint inhibitors by altering the immune-suppressive microenvironment and promoting an anti-tumor immune response. opdivo is designed to overcome immune suppression. the companies will explore the potential of combining these two agents with the goal of achieving improved and sustained efficacy in ccrcc patients with cancer that is stable or growing on a pd-1 inhibitor therapy.   “influencing the tumor microenvironment remains a key area of focus of research, and we are excited to explore the potential benefits of opdivo plus cb-839 in an effort to advance new combination therapies for difficult to treat cancers,” said fouad namouni, m.d., senior vice president, head of oncology development, bristol-myers squibb.   “the combination with opdivo follows our strategy to combine cb-839 with therapies to improve outcomes for rcc patients,” said susan molineaux, ceo of calithera biosciences. “we believe that by blocking glutamine consumption in tumors, and redirecting this key nutrient for cell growth and proliferation to t-cells, cb-839 could enhance the effects of opdivo. with support from bristol-myers squibb, calithera is excited to advance this combination into the phase2 portion of cx-839-004, our ongoing study in ccrcc patients.”   opdivo was the first pd-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world in july 2014, and currently has regulatory approval in 54 countries including the united states, japan, and in the european union.   bristol-myers squibb & immuno-oncology: advancing oncology research   at bristol-myers squibb, we have a vision for the future of cancer care that is focused on immuno-oncology, now considered a major treatment choice alongside surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and targeted therapies for certain types of cancer.   we have a comprehensive clinical portfolio of investigational and approved immuno-oncology agents, many of which were discovered and developed by our scientists. our ongoing immuno-oncology clinical program is looking at broad patient populations, across multiple solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, and lines of therapy and histologies, with the intent of powering our trials for overall survival and other important measures like durability of response. we pioneered the research leading to the first regulatory approval for the combination of two immuno-oncology agents and continue to study the role of combinations in cancer.   we are also investigating other immune system pathways in the treatment of cancer including ctla-4, cd-137, kir, slamf7, pd-1, gitr, csf1r, ido and lag-3. these pathways may lead to potential new treatment options – in combination or monotherapy – to help patients fight different types of cancers.   our collaboration with academia, as well as small and large biotech and pharmaceutical companies, to research the potential of immuno-oncology and non-immuno-oncology combinations helps achieve our goal of providing new treatment options in clinical practice.   at bristol-myers squibb, we are committed to changing survival expectations in hard-to-treat cancers and the way patients live with cancer.   about opdivo   cancer cells may exploit “regulatory” pathways, such as checkpoint pathways, to hide from the immune system and shield the tumor from immune attack. opdivo is a pd-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor that binds to the checkpoint receptor pd-1 expressed on activated t-cells, and blocks the binding of pd-l1 and pd-l2, preventing the pd-1 pathway’s suppressive signaling on the immune system, including the interference with an anti-tumor immune response.   opdivo’s broad global development program is based on bristol-myers squibb’s understanding of the biology behind immuno-oncology. our company is at the forefront of researching the potential of immuno-oncology to extend survival in hard-to-treat cancers. this scientific expertise serves as the basis for the opdivo development program, which includes a broad range of phase3 clinical trials evaluating overall survival as the primary endpoint across a variety of tumor types. the opdivo trials have also contributed toward the clinical and scientific understanding of the role of biomarkers and how patients may benefit from opdivo across the continuum of pd-l1 expression. to date, the opdivo clinical development program has enrolled more than 18,000 patients.   us

been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a pd-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. cases of fatal hyperacute gvhd have also been reported. these complications may occur despite intervening therapy between pd-1 blockade and allogeneic hsct.   follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute gvhd, severe (grade 3 to 4) acute gvhd, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic vod, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly.   embryo-fetal toxicity   based on their mechanisms of action, opdivo and yervoy can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an opdivo- or yervoy- containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of opdivo.   lactation   it is not known whether opdivo or yervoy is present in human milk. because many drugs, including antibodies, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from an opdivo-containing regimen, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment. advise women to discontinue nursing during treatment with yervoy and for 3 months following the final dose.   serious adverse

clinical data in over 2,000 patients across indications. voclosporin is an immunosuppressant, with a synergistic and dual mechanism of action that has the potential to improve near- and long-term outcomes in ln when added to standard of care (mmf). by inhibiting calcineurin, voclosporin blocks il-2 expression and t-cell mediated immune responses. it is made by a modification of a single amino acid of the cyclosporine molecule which has shown a more predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship, an increase in potency, an altered metabolic profile, and potential for flat dosing. the company anticipates that upon regulatory approval, patent protection for voclosporin will be extended in the united states and certain other major markets, including europe and japan, until at least october 2027 under the hatch-waxman act and comparable laws in other countries.   about lupus nephritis (ln) lupus nephritis (ln) in an inflammation of the kidney caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) and represents a serious progression of sle. sle is a chronic, complex and often disabling disorder and affects more than 500,000 people in the united states (mostly women). the disease is highly heterogeneous, affecting a wide range of organs & tissue systems. it is estimated that as many as 60% of all sle patients have clinical ln requiring treatment. unlike sle, ln has straightforward disease outcomes where an early response correlates with long-term outcomes, measured by proteinuria. in patients with ln, renal damage results in proteinuria and/or hematuria and a decrease in renal function as evidenced by reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr), and increased serum creatinine levels. ln is debilitating and costly and if poorly controlled, ln can lead to permanent and irreversible tissue damage within the kidney, resulting in end-stage renal disease (esrd), thus making ln a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.   about aurinia aurinia is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapies to treat targeted patient populations that are suffering from serious diseases with a high unmet medical need. the company is currently developing voclosporin, an investigational drug, for the treatment of lupus nephritis (ln). the company is headquartered in victoria, bc and focuses its development efforts globally. www.auriniapharma.com.
